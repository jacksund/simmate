# Longleaf

Longleaf is a Linux-based computing system available for free to researchers across UNC Chapel Hill's campus. Workloads where each job requires a single compute host are best suited for this cluster.

> :bulb: This guide should be used alongside tutorial 02 ([here](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/blob/main/tutorials/02_%20Run_a_workflow.md#switching-to-a-remote-cluster)).

# The Simmate checklist

From the posted requirements:

1. a VASP license for your team **(COMPLETED)**
2. a remote cluster that you have a profile with 
3. VASP installed on the remote cluster **(COMPLETED)**
4. Anaconda installed on the remote cluster **(COMPLETED)**
5. Simmate installed on the remote cluster
6. VASP Potentials in `~/simmate/vasp/Potentials` on the remote cluster. Feel free to reach out with Scott with questions (scw@email.unc.edu)

For the uncompleted requirements:

2. you must create a profile on longleaf with your onyen. Contact UNC ITS to enquire about making a profile.
5. make your personal environment named `yourname_env` (e.g. `jacks_env`)
6. follow tutorial 02 ([here](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/blob/main/tutorials/02_%20Run_a_workflow.md#configuring-potentials-for-vasp-users)) to set up VASP potentials

<br/>

## Load VASP with...
```
module vasp/5.4.4
```

<br/>

## Call VASP with... 
```
mpirun vasp_std
```

<br/>

## Create your conda env with...
```
conda create -n my_env -c conda-forge python=3.8 simmate
conda activate my_env
# and initialize your database for the first time
simmate database reset
```

<br/>

## Access scratch directory with...
```
cd /pine/scr/y/o/youronyen
```

<br/>

## Create a SLURM script with...
```
nano submit.sh
```

<br/>

And paste in the example content...
```
#! /bin/sh

#SBATCH -J holder
#SBATCH -n 20
#SBATCH -N 1

#SBATCH -p general
#SBATCH -o slurm.out
#SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
#SBATCH --mail-user=youronyen@live.unc.edu
#SBATCH -t 11-00:00

simmate workflows run energy-mit POSCAR -c "mpirun vasp_std > vasp.out"
```

<br/>

## Submit with...
Checklist before submitting:
1. loaded the VASP module
2. activated your conda environment
3. in the temporary working directory (/pine/scr/y/o/youronyen)
4. created `submit.sh` and edited contents as needed
5. structure file (e.g. `POSCAR`) is present in working directory

Once all of these are met, you can submit with...
```
sbatch submit.sh
```

<br/>

## Monitor progress with...
