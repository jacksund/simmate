# Setting up DigitalOcean database and website servers

> :warning: You can avoid this guide if you choose to collaborate with Simmate! Make sure you have read through [our database tutorial](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/blob/main/tutorials/06_Use_a_cloud_database.md) before deciding to take on the work of managing your own database and server.

In this guide, you will learn how to setup a cloud database and webserver for Simmate using DigitalOcean.

## Setting up an account

To start, make an account on DigitalOcean using [this link](https://m.do.co/c/8aeef2ea807c) (which uses our refferal). We recommend using your Github account to sign in. This referral link does two things:

1. DigitialOcean gives you $100 credit for servers (for 60 days)
2. DigitialOcean gives the Simmate team $10 credit, which will help fund our servers

If you have issues with this, please make sure that DigitalOcean is still actually offering this deal [here](https://try.digitalocean.com/freetrialoffer/). Simmate is not affiliated with DigitalOcean, so please contact them with issues!

## Autotomically setting up our DigitalOcean database and servers

This button below will launch a new DigitalOcean app (server+database) using a template from our team. Make sure you have already signed-in to your DigitalOcean account before opening the link. 

Once open, you can provide your Prefect API key (optional) and a  secret key for Django.

</a>

> :warning: Note to developers, if you fork this repository and want this button to work for your new repo, you must update the link for this button. For more information, see [here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/add-deploy-do-button/)

Steps to set up servers on DigitalOcean:

1. Make sure you created a DigitalOcean account (you can use your Github account) and are signed in
2. Select the "Deploy to DigitalOcean" button above. On this new page, you'll see "Python Detected".
3. Under "Environment Variables", update `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` to a random password using only numbers and letters. You can use [this random-password site](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) to generate your random key.
4. (if you'd like to use Prefect) Under "Environment Variables", update `PREFECT__CLOUD__API_KEY` to an API key from your [Prefect dashboard](https://cloud.prefect.io/team/service-accounts). You can also use your github account for Prefect.
5. Move on to the next page, and complete the information as you see fit! When selecting server size, you can go as small as you'd like -- even the basic plan for 500MB + 1CPU will suffice. Note, the starter database is can be switched out later on.
6. Once you launch your app, the first build can take 15-30 minutes. Once complete, you should be able to view your new Simmate website at the link shown.
7. The website won't work properly right away. This is because we haven't built database tables. Go to the "Console" tab and initalize your database with...
``` bash
simmate database reset
```
8. Database connection details are found in the "Settings" tab -> "simmate-starter-database" component -> "Connection details". You can use the [connect-to-database section](#connecting-to-the-database) section below to connect to this server on your local computer and start submitting calculations!
9. As your group grows, you may want to switch to a larger database than the starter one. To do this, you'll have to setup a managed database on DigitalOcean. To do this in your App, select "Actions" -> "Create/Attach Database".

## Manual setup (stage 1): Setting up our PostgreSQL Database

> :warning: This section is only required if you do not wish to use the automatic setup described in the section above it -- or if you need a customized setup.

First, we need to set up our Cloud database, tell Simmate how to connect to it, and build our tables.

### creating the cloud database

1. On our DigitalOcean dashboard, click the green "Create" button in the top right and then select "Database". It should bring you to [this page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases/new).
2. For "database engine", select the newest version of PostgreSQL (currently v14)
3. The remainder of the page's options can be left at their default values.
4. Select **Create a Database Cluster** when you're ready.
5. For the new homepage on your cluster, there is a "Get Started" button. We will go through this dialog in the next section.

Note, this is the database **cluster**, which can host multiple databases on it (each with all their own tables).


### connecting to the database

Before we set up our database on this cluster, we are are first going to try connecting the default database on it (named `defaultdb`).

1. On your new database's page, you'll see a "Getting Started" dialog -- select it!
2. For "Restrict inbound connections", this is completely optional and beginneers should skip this for now. We skip this because if you know you'll be running calculations on some supercomputer/cluster, then you'll need to add all of the associated IP addresses in order for connections to work properly. That's a lot of IP addresses to grab and configure properly -- so we leave this to advanced users.
3. "Connection details" is what we need to give to Simmate/Django. Let's copy this information. As an example, here is what the details look like on DigitalOcean:
```
username = doadmin
password = asd87a9sd867fasd
host = db-postgresql-nyc3-49797-do-user-8843535-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com
port = 25060
database = defaultdb
sslmode = require
```
4. We need to pass this information to Simmate (which connects using Django). To do this, add a file named `my_env-database.yaml` (using your conda env name) to your simmate config directory (`~/simmate`) with the following content -- be sure substute in your connection information and note that ENGINE tells Django we are using Postgres:
``` yaml
default:
  ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
  HOST: db-postgresql-nyc3-49797-do-user-8843535-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com
  NAME: defaultdb
  USER: doadmin
  PASSWORD: asd87a9sd867fasd
  PORT: 25060
  OPTIONS:
    sslmode: require
```
5. Make sure you can connect to this database on your local computer by running the following in Spyder:
``` python
from simmate.configuration.django.settings import DATABASES

print(DATABASES)  # this should give your connect info!
```


### making a separate the database for testing (on the same server)

Just like how we don't use the `(base)` environment in Anaconda, we don't want to use the default database `defaultdb` on our cluster. Here will make a new database -- one that we can delete if we'd  like to restart.

1. On DigitalOcean with your Database Cluster page, select the "Users&Databases" tab.
2. Create a new database using the "Add new database" button and name this `simmate-database-00`. We name it this way because you may want to make new/separate databases and numbering is a quick way to keep track of these.
3. In your connection settings (from the section above), switch the NAME from defaultdb to `simmate-database-00`. You will change this in your `my_env-database.yaml` file.

Additionally, we can use this approach to build a separate database for Prefect to use. Go through through these steps again where we now are configuring a database for Prefect:

1. On DigitalOcean with your Database Cluster page, select the "Users&Databases" tab.
2. Create a new database using the "Add new database" button and name this `prefect-database-00`.
3. We need to tell Prefect how to connect. You can follow the official [Prefect guides](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/concepts/database/). You can access the URL under by selecting the "Connection String" format on DigitalOcean (note, we remove the `?sslmode=require`. For example, you would set an environment variable like so...
``` bash
# added to bottom of ~/.bashrc for Ubuntu
export PREFECT_ORION_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://doadmin:asd87a9sd867fasd@db-postgresql-nyc3-49797-do-user-8843535-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com:5432/prefect-database-00"
```


<!-- 
TODO: allow prefect to be configured alongside the Simmate database:

or you can add add `prefect` entry to your `my_env-database.yaml` file.

Your final `my_env-database.yaml` file will look like this:
```
default:
  ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
  HOST: db-postgresql-nyc3-49797-do-user-8843535-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com
  NAME: simmate-database-00  # WE WILL UPDATE THIS IN THE NEXT STEP
  USER: doadmin
  PASSWORD: asd87a9sd867fasd
  PORT: 25060
  OPTIONS:
    sslmode: require

prefect:
  ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
  HOST: db-postgresql-nyc3-49797-do-user-8843535-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com
  NAME: prefect-database-00  # WE WILL UPDATE THIS IN THE NEXT STEP
  USER: doadmin
  PASSWORD: asd87a9sd867fasd
  PORT: 25060
  OPTIONS:
    sslmode: require
```
-->

### creating a connection pool

When we have a bunch of calculations running at once, we need to make sure our database can handle all of these connections. Therefore we make a connection pool which allows for thousands of connections! This "pool" works like a waitlist where the database handles each connection request in order.

1. Select the "Connection Pools" tab and then "Create a Connection Pool"
2. Name your pool `simmate-database-00-pool` and select `simmate-database-00` for the database
3. Select "Transaction" for our mode (the default) and set our pool size to **8** (or modify this value as you wish)
4. Create the pool when you're ready!
5. You'll have to update your `my_env-database.yaml` file to these connection settings. At this point your file will look similar to this (note, our NAME and PORT values have changed):
``` yaml
default:
  ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
  HOST: db-postgresql-nyc3-49797-do-user-8843535-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com
  NAME: simmate-database-00-pool  # THIS LINE WAS UPDATED
  USER: doadmin
  PASSWORD: asd87a9sd867fasd
  PORT: 25061
  OPTIONS:
    sslmode: require
```
6. Repeat these steps to create a `prefect-database-00-pool`.


### making all of our database tables

Now that we set up and connected to our database, we can now make our Simmate database tables and start filling them with data! We do this the same way we did without a cloud database:

1. In your terminal, make sure you have you Simmate enviornment activated
2. Run the following command: 
``` bash
simmate database reset
```
3. You're now ready to start using Simmate with your new database!
4. If you want to share this database with others, you simply need to have them copy your config file: `my_env-database.yaml`. They won't need to run `simmate database reset` because you did it for them.

We need to do the same with Prefect too.

1. In your terminal, make sure you have you Simmate enviornment activated
2. Run the following command: 
``` bash
prefect orion database reset
```

## Manual setup (stage 2): Setting up a Django Website Server

If you want to host your Simmate installation as website just for you team, you can use DigitalOcean to host a Django Website server.

This section follows the tutorials listed here. If you are struggling with our guide or want additional explanation, you can refer to these sources:
1. [Overview that links to other tutorials](https://docs.digitalocean.com/tutorials/app-deploy-django-app/)
2. [Step-by-step guide along with how to configure settings.py](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-django-to-app-platform)
3. [Example github repo to practice with](https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-django)

### uploading our project to github
(TODO --> maybe link to another tutorial)

### setting up our website server

1. On our DigitalOcean dashboard, click the green "Create" button in the top right and then select "Apps". It should bring you to [this page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new).
2. Select Github (and give github access if this is your first time)
3. For your "Source", we want to select our project. For me, this is "jacksund/simmate". Leave everything else at its default.
4. When you go to the next page, you should see that Python was detected. We will now update some of these settings in steps 5-8.
5. Edit "Enviornment Variables" to include the following. Also note that we are connecting to our database pool and that your secret key should be [randomly generated](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) and encrypted!:
```
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=${APP_DOMAIN}
DEBUG=False
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=randomly-generated-passord-12345
USE_LOCAL_DATABASE=False
PREFECT__CLOUD__API_KEY=your-prefect-api-key
```
> note to simmate devs: [consider switching to setting all database variables directly](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/use-environment-variables/)
> note for prefect: in the future, I may want to link API keys to profiles so that we can submit to proper clouds -- rather than assume all go through a single prefect account.

6. Change our "Build Command" to... (`pip install .` is ran automatically)
```
pip install gunicorn psycopg2; prefect backend cloud;
```

<!-- Currently, I'm trying to install blender but running into issues...
wget https://download.blender.org/release/Blender3.1/blender-3.1.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
tar -xf blender-3.1.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
rm blender-3.1.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
./blender --version  (DOES NOT WORK)
-->

7. Change our "Run Command" to...
```
gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm simmate.website.core.wsgi
```
8. Use the button at the bottom of this page to connect to our PostgreSQL database set-up above
9. We can stick with the defaults for the rest of the pages! Create your server when you're ready!


### creating our static file server (CDN)

> :warning: it looks like DigitalOcean is updating the way this is done, so [their guide] is no longer accurate. My guide below may also be outdated.

Everything for our website should work except for the static files. This is because Django doesn't serve static files when DEBUG=False. They want us to serve these separately as a static site (via a CDN). This isn't a big deal because the extra server is free for us on DigitalOcean.

1. On our current app, go to "Settings" and then select "+Add Component" button on the top right. We want to add a "Static Site"
2. Select the same github repo as before and make sure python is detected
3. On this page, change "HTTP Request Routes" to `/static` and  the "Output Directory" to `/src/simmate/website/static`
4. That's it! Start the server when you're ready!


## setting up our website domain name (simmate.org)

We use google domains as I found it had the easiest setup and cheapest prices.
For connecting this to DigitalOcean, I followed these guides: [1](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/manage-domains/), [2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars), [3](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records/). These can give extra details if the steps below aren't enough.

1. Purchase your website (domain) name on https://domains.google.com/registrar/
2. Select the domain you just purchased and now go to its "DNS" tab. For example, ours brings us to https://domains.google.com/registrar/simmate.org/DNS
3. Switch to the "Custom name servers" tab and add the following three servers:
    - ns1.digitalocean.com
    - ns2.digitalocean.com
    - ns3.digitalocean.com
4. Save these and be sure to select "Switch to these settings" at the top to enable them
5. Jump back to your DigitalOcean dashboard and go to the [Networking tab](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/domains)
6. The first page here is the Domain view where you should now add your new domain name
7. Now switch back to our DigitalOcean App (from above) and go to settings
8. Under "Domains", we want to edit and then add `simmate.org` (or your chosen name). Let DigitalOcean manages the DNS.

# Dockerfile-based build

> :warning: this section holds notes for Simmate developers and will help implement future features. Users can ignore this section for now.

This build fails at the moment, but I still include the `Dockerfile` and `deploy.template.Dockerfile.yaml` files future reference --  as I'd like to revisit Dockerfile-based builds. These would have the advantage of (1) installing everything using Anaconda and (2) installing extra programs such as Blender.

Taha Fatima was trying help troubleshoot, but I dropped my attempt once I ran into "memory exceeded" errors during my build. Taha mentioned that this can be fixed using Github Actions, so the following links would be the  best place to give this another attempt:
  - https://github.com/digitalocean/app_action
  - https://github.com/tahafatimaDO/test-DOCR
