# Release History

Our releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This means versions (e.g. `v1.2.3`) correspond to `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Each version number increases after the following changes:

  - `MAJOR` = incompatible API changes
  - `MINOR` = new functionality is added (w/o API changes)
  - `PATCH` = bug fixes and documentation updates (w/o API changes)

There is one key exception to the rules above -- and that is with `MAJOR`=0 releases. Any v0.x.y release is considered developmental where APIs are subject to change and should not be considered stable. This is consistent with the semantic version spec (see [point 4](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4)).

# Upcoming Release
> :bulb: for ongoing changes that have not been finalized/merged yet, view our [active pull-requests](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/pulls) on github
- update CI to test all OSs and pin pytest<7.1 as temporary fix for [#162](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/162)
- fix spelling typos in `keyword_modifiers` ([@laurenmm](https://github.com/laurenmm), [#165](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/pull/165))
- users can now apply their own unique keyword modifiers to Incars -- such as how we allow "__per_atom" or "__smart_ismear" tags on Incar settings. This change involved refactoring how `keyword_modifiers` are implemented for the `vasp.inputs.Incar` class. Rather than static methods attached to the base class, modifiers are now dynamically applied using the `add_keyword_modifier` classmethod.
- large update of `calculators.vasp.tasks` module where many new presets are reimplemented from [`pymatgen.io.vasp.sets`](https://pymatgen.org/pymatgen.io.vasp.sets.html). This includes robust unit testing to confirm that generated inputs match between simmate and pymatgen (see [#157](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/157) for a list of presets)
- catch error with vasp freezing when `Brmix` handler switches to kerker mixing ([@becca9835](https://github.com/becca9835), [#159](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/159))
