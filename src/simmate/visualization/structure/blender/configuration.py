# Calling Blender is currently a messy business because there's no easy
# way to install it as a python module. Instead we need to install Blender
# separately and have it execute scripts from the command-line. To do this,
# we need to check and see if Blender is installed, and if not, warn the user.
# This is different for each operating system, and each is outlined here:
#   https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/launch/index.html
