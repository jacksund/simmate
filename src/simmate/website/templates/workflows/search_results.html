          This block would query Prefect cloud a bunch using logic like...  

              if calculation.flow_run_view:
                name = calculation.prefect_flow_run_name # and link to calculation.prefect_cloud_link
                state = calculation.prefect_state
              else:
                name = None
                state = None

          These queries are slow AND state should be dynamically updated -- Therefore this should be
          done on the front-end. I don't yet know the Javascript needed for this, but I would use
          a prefect api key from the User and use it to query their prefect cloud here.

          For now, I simply leave the next two columns empty to prevent the slow-down.

                    Make sure you don't have a typo in your search. If you are searching
                    for "Li-Co-O", common typos include searching "LiCoO" (missing hyphens),
                    "Li-Co-O-" (extra hyphen), or "li-co-o" (lowercase). We are working
                    to account for these common mistakes, but you'll have to fix these until then!
