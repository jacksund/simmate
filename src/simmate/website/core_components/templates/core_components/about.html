                                    Jack Sundberg started Simmate while working towards his PhD
                                    in Chemistry at UNC Chapel Hill. This took place in
                                    <a href="https://materials-lab.io/people/" target="_blank">Scott Warren's lab</a>,
                                    which focused on exotic materials known as electrides
                                    and their potential as fluoride-ion batteries. At the time, only
                                    crystalline materials were in scope, abd molecular features didn't
                                    come until later. This is why we came up with the name "Simmate", which
                                    is short for "<b>Sim</b>ulated <b>Mat</b>erials <b>E</b>cosytem" -- i.e., a suite of
                                    tools for computational materials chemistry. "<b>Sim</b>ulation <b>Mate</b> (i.e., buddy/helper)"
                                    became an alternative interpretation over time.

                                    This website was <em>VERY</em> different from what it is today.
                                    Even though we didn't have many features at the time, we
                                    reserved the simmate.org domain, and the first version
                                    of our website was made publicall available. It was a basic
                                    (and, admittedly, mostly broken) website because we were new
                                    to frontend web development, and our priority was to focus
                                    on the backend & research. The public website remainly
                                    largely untouched for a couple of years while we worked
                                    on adding new features in local development.

                                    It set the groundwork for a lot of core Simmate features: (1) integration to
                                    popular databases like the Materials Project, (2) workflow orchestration
                                    of thousands of DFT calculations, (3) a central database to analyze
                                    results, and (4) lower-level utilies for chemistry data.

                                    as "a framework for materials science" in the Journal
                                    of Open-Source Software (JOSS). It was heavily focused on data
                                    from the materials science community and automating workflows
                                    using VASP (a commerical DFT software). So even though a lot
                                    of the key features were present, Simmate was still only useful
                                    to a small few. Nevertheless, it remained an incredibly impactful

                                    Jack Sundberg continued to be the primary maintainer for Simmate
                                    and even utilize it in some of his work in industry -- where his
                                    research focused on molecular systems, as opposed
                                    to the crystalline systems Simmate was originally built for.
                                    After a series of reviews and approvals, he was allowed to
                                    contribute many features for molecular systems to the open-source
                                    Simmate codebase. This also sparked a large reorganization of
                                    the framework's core functionality and features. With the scope
                                    expanding, Simmate began organizing functionality into "apps"
                                    separate from the core framework -- a strategy that led to
                                    much more rapid development of features and integrations.

                                    Up to this point, the Simmate website wasn't recieving much
                                    attention -- the workflows, database, and toolkit stole the
                                    focus. Efforts were made to establish web-building tools,
                                    but they weren't super easy to use. But in 2025, we were able to
                                    refactor our frontend framework to handle dynamically change pages
                                    and partial updates - and do so in a way that was as easy as
                                    building a streamlit dashboard. It was at this point we started
                                    our website rebuild to be much more user friendly and to truly
                                    leverage the backend orchestration of workflows and data.
