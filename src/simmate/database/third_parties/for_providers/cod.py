> :warning: This file is only for use by the Simmate team. Users should instead
access data via the load_remote_archive method.

This file is for pulling COD data into the Simmate database. 

The COD let's you download all of their data as a zip file 
[here](http://www.crystallography.net/archives/). While they do have a
REST API, it looks like they prefer you to use the zip file if you want all structures
and metadata. This is a big download even when compressed (18GB), so it's a slow
process -- but more importantly a stable one. For future reference though, the REST
API is outlined [here](https://wiki.crystallography.net/RESTful_API/).

Once downloaded, all of the cif files are organized into folders based on their first
few numbers -- for example, the cif 1234567 would be in folder /cif/1/23/45/1234567.cif
It's an odd way of storing the files, but we just need to script open all of the folders.
Note that some folders also don't have any cifs in them! There is also extra data
in each cif file -- such as the doi of the paper it came from.

There looks to be a lot of problematic cif files in the COD, but it's not worth parsing
through all of these. Instead, I simply try to load the cif file into a pymatgen
Structure object, and if it fails, I just move on. I'm slowly adding functionality
to account for these problematic cif files though.
