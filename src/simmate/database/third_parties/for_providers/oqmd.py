This file is for pulling OQMD data into the Simmate database. 

There are many ways to pull from this database, but it looks like the easiest
is the qmpy_rester python package. This officially supported and maintained
at https://github.com/mohanliu/qmpy_rester. For now the package is only available
via a pip install.

For other options such as the REST API, check out http://oqmd.org/static/docs/restful.html
