    Goes through all third-party databases and loads their most recent remote
    archives (if available). This utility helps with initializing a new
    database build.

    Accepts the same parameters as the `load_remote_archive` method

    WARNING:
    This can take several hours to run and there is no pause/continuation
    implemented. This runs substantially faster when you are using a cloud
    database backend (e.g. Postgres) and use `parallel=True`.

    If you are using SQLite, we highly recommend using `load_default_sqlite3_build`
    instead of this utility, which downloads a full database that was built using
    this method.
