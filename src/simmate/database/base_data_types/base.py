        - `index`:
            specify the field to use  for the index. If the index field is not
            in fieldnames it will be appended. This is mandatory for timeseries.
        - `verbose`:
            If  this is `True` then populate the DataFrame with the human
            readable versions for foreign key fields else use the actual values
            set in the model

            Attempt to convert values to non-string, non-numeric objects (like
            decimal.Decimal) to floating point.
