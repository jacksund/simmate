        Dynamically creates subclass of MigrationImage, then links it to the
        MigrationHop table.

        This method should NOT be called directly because it is instead used by
        `DiffusionAnalysis.create_subclasses`.

        #### Parameters

        - `name` :
            Name of the subclass that is output.
        - `migration_hop` :
            MigrationHop table that these images should be associated with.
        - `module` :
            name of the module this subclass should be associated with. Typically,
            you should pass __name__ to this.
        - `**extra_columns` :
            Additional columns to add to the table. The keyword will be the
            column name and the value should match django options
            (e.g. table_column.FloatField())

        #### Returns

        - `NewClass` :
            A subclass of MigrationImage.
