    # I may want to add these fields because Prefect doesn't store run stats
    # indefinitely AND it doesn't give detail memory use, number of cores, etc.

    # average_memory (The average memory used in kb)
    # max_memory (The maximum memory used in kb)
    # elapsed_time (The real time elapsed in seconds)
    # system_time(The system CPU time in seconds)
    # user_time(The user CPU time spent by VASP in seconds)

    # While there are no base relations for this abstract class, the majority of

    # the same calculation multiple times. Otherwise it would be a OneToOneField.
