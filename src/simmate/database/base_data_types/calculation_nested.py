    """
    A nested calculation is extremely similar to a calculation table, except here
    the linked workflow is a NestedWorkflow -- meaning it is made of multiple
    smaller workflows. For example, we may want to run a workflow that runs a
    series of relaxations. Or maybe a relaxation, then energy, then band-strucuture
    calculation. This table is for keeping track of workflows ran in series like
    this.

    Typically, you'll use the `create_subclass_from_calcs` method to create a
    subclass of this table, which handles making all the relationships for you.

        Dynamically creates a subclass of NestedCalculation -- and handles linking
        together all child calculation tables.

        `simmate.calculators.vasp.database.relaxation` shows an example of creating
        a table from this class:

        ``` python
        StagedRelaxation = NestedCalculation.create_subclass_from_calcs(
            "StagedRelaxation",
            [
                Quality00Relaxation,
                Quality01Relaxation,
                Quality02Relaxation,
                Quality03Relaxation,
                Quality04Relaxation,
            ],
            module=__name__,
        )
        ```

        To add custom columns, you can do the following:

        ``` python
        from simmate.database.base_data_types import table_column

        StagedRelaxation = NestedCalculation.create_subclass_from_calcs(
            ... # everything is the same as above
            custom_column_01=table_column.FloatField()
        )
        ```

        #### Parameters

        - `name` :
            Name of the subclass that is output.
        - `child_calculation_tables` :
            list of database tables for the nested workflows. This table links
            these sub-tables together so results can be viewed from each step.
        - `module` :
            name of the module this subclass should be associated with. Typically,
            you should pass __name__ to this.
        **extra_columns : TYPE
            Additional columns to add to the table. The keyword will be the
            column name and the value should match django options
            (e.g. table_column.FloatField())

        #### Returns

        NewClass :
            A subclass of NestedCalculation.
