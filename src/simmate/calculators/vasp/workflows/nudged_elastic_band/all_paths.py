    Runs a full diffusion analysis on a bulk crystal structure using NEB.
    
    The bulk structure will be geometry optimized and then 
    `simmate.toolkit.diffusion.DistinctPathFinder` is used to find all
    symmetrically unique migration hops in the structure up until the hops 
    become percolating (>0-D). For each unique hop, the workflow 
    diffusion/single_path is submitted.

    This is therefore a "Nested Workflow" made of the following smaller workflows:

        - relaxation/mit
        - static-energy/mit
        - a mini task that identifies unique migration hops
        - (for each hop) diffusion/single-path
    
    If you are running this workflow via the command-line, you can run this 
    with...
    
    ``` bash
    simmate workflows run diffusion/all-paths -s example.cif -c "cmd1; cmd2; cmd3"
    ```
    
    Note, the `-c` here is very important! Here we are passing three commands
    separated by semicolons. Each command is passed to a specific workflow call:
        
        - cmd1 --> used for bulk crystal relaxation and static energy
        - cmd2 --> used for endpoint supercell relaxations
        - cmd3 --> used for NEB
    
    Thus, you can scale your resources for each step. Here's a full -c option:
    
    -c "vasp_std > vasp.out; mpirun -n 12 vasp_std > vasp.out; mpirun -n 70 vasp_std > vasp.out"
