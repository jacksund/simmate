class MITNudgedElasticBand(NEBEndpointRelaxation):
    """
    Runs a NEB relaxation on a list of structures (aka images) using MIT Project
    settings. The lattice remains fixed and symmetry is turned off for this
    relaxation.

    You shouldn't use this workflow directly, but instead use the higher-level
    NEB workflows (e.g. diffusion/neb_all_paths or diffusion/neb_from_endpoints),
    which call this workflow for you.


    Developer Notes
    ----------------

    This NEB task is very different from all other VASP tasks!

    The first big difference is that it takes a list of structures instead of
    just one structure. This means that instead of "structure=...", you should
    actually do "structures=[structure1, structure2, structure3, ...]", where
    the list of structures is your list of images.

    The second big difference is that VASP uses a different folder setup when
    running these calculations. It has a series of folders named 00, 01, 02, ... N,
    where 00 is the starting image, N is the endpoint image, and 01 to (N-1) are
    the midpoint images. Simmate handles this inside the task, but knowing this
    may be useful if you'd like to make your own variation of this class.
