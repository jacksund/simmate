    A base class for Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations. This is not meant
    to be used directly but instead should be inherited from.

    Note, NEB tasks are very different from all other VASP tasks!

    The first big difference is that it takes a list of structures instead of
    just one structure. This means that instead of "structure=...", you should
    actually do "structures=[structure1, structure2, structure3, ...]", where
    the list of structures is your list of images.

    The second big difference is that VASP uses a different folder setup when
    running these calculations. It has a series of folders named 00, 01, 02, ... N,
    where 00 is the starting image, N is the endpoint image, and 01 to (N-1) are
    the midpoint images. Simmate handles this inside the task, but knowing this
    may be useful if you'd like to make your own variation of this class.
