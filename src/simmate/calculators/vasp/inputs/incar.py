    You can consider the dict(kwargs) as equivalent to Incar(parameters).

    If you want a given setting to be dependent on the structure or dynamically
    determined, then we implement these modifiers. This would enable us to
    do things like ENCUT__per_atom or NGZF__density. We can even have more complex
    modifiers like multiple_keywords__smart_ldau which signals that our
    "smart_ldau" modifier introduces more than one new setting to the INCAR, such
    as LDAUJ, LDAUU, LDAUL, LDAUTYPE, and LDAUPRINT.

    TODO: In the future, I want to allow modifiers like __relative_to_previous
    and __use_previous to string settings accross tasks.
