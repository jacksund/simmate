class DeepmdDataset:
    """
    This class works simply as a converter. You provide it a list of
    IonicStepStructures that have forces and energies, and it will create a
    deepmd input for you.

    The input consists of 2 "type" files and then a subfolder made of 4 files for
    the actaul data. An example folder looks like this:
        type.raw
        type_map.raw
        set.000
            box.npy
            coord.npy
            energy.npy
            force.npy

    The "type" files are very simple. "type_map.raw" is just a list of elements
    and the "type.raw" is our composition listing what each site is. For example,
    H20 (water) would just be...
        type_map.raw --> H O
        type.raw --> 0 0 1

    These .npy are "numpy" files, where the data included in each is...
      box = lattice matrixes
      coord = site's cartesian coordinates
      energy = calculated energies
      force = calculated forces for sites

    All data is collapsed to 1D arrays. For example, this means the 3x3 lattice matrix
    becomes a 1x9 list of numbers and the entire file is a list of matricies in this
    format. The same is done to forces, coords, and energies.

    Note this is the folder/file format for EACH composition. So this class creates
    many of these folders if you provide input structures that have varying
    compositions (such as CoO2, Co2O4, Co3O6, etc.).

    Further, we split the input structures into training and test datasets. So
    the final folder setup will look like...
    deepmd_data
        CoO2_train
        CoO2_test
        Co2O4_train
        Co2O4_test
        << etc. >>

    All data required is available from an IonicStepStructure in our database, so
    this is our current input format.
