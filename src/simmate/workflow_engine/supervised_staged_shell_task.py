# The Supervised-Staged-Shell Task (aka "S3Task")

This class contains the core functionality to **supervise** a **staged** task
involving some **shell** command.

Let's breakdown what this means...

A *shell* command is a single call to some external program. For example,
VASP requires that we call the "vasp_std > vasp.out" command in order to run a
calculation. We consider calling external programs a *staged* task made
up of three steps:

- setup = writing any input files required for the program
- execution = actually calling the command and running our program
- workup = loading data from output files back into python

And for *supervising* the task, this means we monitor the program while the
execution stage is running. So once a program is started, Simmate can check
output files for common errors/issues. If an error is found, we stop the
program, fix the issue, and then restart it. Any fixes that were made are
written to "simmate_corrections.csv".


<!--
TODO: Make a simple diagram to visualize the overall process and add it here.
It will be similar to Custodian's, but we don't have a list of jobs here.
https://materialsproject.github.io/custodian/index.html#usage
The steps are...

- Write Input Files based on custom+defualt settings
- Run the calculation by calling the program
- Load ouput files
- check for errors
- [correct them, rerun]
- postprocess/analysis
-->

This entire process (the different stages and monitoring) is carried out
using the `run` method. You rarely use this class directly. Instead,
you typically use a subclass of it. As a user, you really just need to do
something like this:

``` python
from simmate.calculator.example.tasks import ExampleTask

my_task = ExampleTask()
my_result = my_task.run()
```

And that's it!

For experts, this class can be viewed as a combination of prefect's ShellTask,
a custodian Job, and Custodian monitoring. When subclassing this, we can absorb
functionality of `pymatgen.io.vasp.sets` too. By merging all of these together
into one class, we make things much easier for users and creating new Tasks.


# Building a custom S3task

This class is commonly used to make tasks for our calculator modules, so you
will likely want to subclass this. Here is a basic example of inheriting
and then running a task:

``` python

from simmate.workflow_engine import S3Task
from example.error_handlers import PossibleError1, PossibleError2


class ExampleTask(SSSTask):

    command = "echo example"  # just prints out "example"
    
    # settings for error handling
    max_corrections = 7
    error_handlers = [PossibleError1, PossibleError2]
    polling_timestep = 0.1
    monitor_freq = 10
    
    # custom attributes
    some_new_setting = 123

    @classmethod
    def setup(cls, directory, custom_parmeter, **kwargs):
        print("I'm setting things up!")
        print(f"My new setting value is {cls.some_new_setting}")
        print(f"My new parameter value is {custom_parmeter}")

    @staticmethod
    def workup(directory):
        print("I'm working things up!")


task = ExampleTask()
result = task.run()
```

There are a two important things to note here:

1. It's optional to write new `setup` or `workup` methods. But if you do...
    - Both `setup` and `workup` method should be either a staticmethod or classmethod
    - Custom `setup` methods require the `directory` and `**kwargs` input parameters.
    - Custom `workup` methods require the `directory` input paramter
2. It's optional to set/overwrite attributes. You can also add new ones too.

For a full (and advanced) example, of a subclass take a look at
`simmate.calculators.vasp.tasks.base.VaspTask` and the tasks that use it like
`simmate.calculators.vasp.tasks.relaxation.matproj`.

        criteria is that you...

        This method is called at the end of a job, *after* error detection.
        This allows post-processing, such as cleanup, analysis of results,
        etc. This should return the result of the entire job, such as a
        the final structure or final energy calculated.

        When writing a custom S3Task, you can overwrite this method. The only
        criteria is that you...

        1. include `directory` as an input parameters
        2. decorate your method with `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod`

        These criteria allow for compatibility with higher-level functinality.

        You should never call this method directly unless you are debugging. This
        is becuase `workup` is normally called within the `run` method.

        Some tasks don't require a `workup` method, so by default, this method
        doesn't nothing but "pass".
