This module defines the base class for all workflows in Simmate. When learning 
how use workflows, make sure you have gone through our intro 
[tutorials](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/tree/main/tutorials). You
can then read through these guides for more features.

It useful to know that our Worklfow class builds Prefect Flows under the 
hood, so having knowledge of Prefect can be useful in advanced cases. For 
advanced use or when building new features, we recommend going through the
prefect tutorials located
[here](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/tutorials/first-steps/).



# Using existing workflows


## Loading a workflow

To import a specific workflow, see the `simmate.workflows` module. For all the
example uses below, we will look at the `static-energy.vasp.matproj` workflow,
which we load with:
    
``` python
from simmate.workflows.all import StaticEnergy__Vasp__Matproj as workflow
```


## Viewing input parameters



## Running a workflow (local)

To run a workflow locally (i.e. directly on your current computer), you can
use the `run` method. This is returns a Prefect `State` object, which allows
you to check if the run completed successfully or not. Then final output of your
workflow run can be accessed using `state.result()`. You can read more about
`State` objects [here](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/concepts/states/), but as
a quick example:

``` python
state = workflow.run(
    structure="NaCl.cif", 
    command="mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out",
)

if state.is_completed():  # optional check
    result = state.result()
```

Outside of python, you can also run workflows from the command line, using YAML 
files, or the website interface. These approaches are covered in the intro
tutorials.


## Running a workflow (cloud)

When you want to schedule a workflow to run elsewhere, you must first make sure
you have your computational resources configured. You can then run workflows
using the `run_cloud` method, which returns a Prefect flow run id.

``` python
prefect_flow_run_id = workflow.run_cloud(
    structure="NaCl.cif", 
    command="mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out",
)
```

## Accessing results

In addition to using `state.result()` as described above, you can also view
results database through the `database_table` attribute (if one is available).
This returns a Simmate database object for results of ALL runs of this workflow.
Guides for filtering and manulipating the data in this table is covered in
the `simmate.database` module guides. But as an example:

``` python
table = workflow.database_table

# pandas dataframe that you can view in Spyder
df = table.obects.to_dataframe()

# or grab a specific run result and convert to a toolkit object
entry = table.objects.get(prefect_flow_run_id="example-123456")
structure = entry.to_toolkit()
```

<!--
TODO:
    - viewing parameter names
    - accessing results (database_table)
    - run_cloud and other cloud methods
    - different documentation levels (parameters, mini docstring, etc.)
    - finding the same workflow in the website UI (place this )
-->

# Creating new workflows

## Naming workflows (required)

Higher level features such as the website interface require that workflow
names follow a certain format. If you skip this step, your workflows
will fail and cause errors elsewhere.

First, we need to update the workflow name to match Simmate's naming
conventions, which includes:
    1.  The type of analysis the workflow is doing
    2.  The "calculator" (or program) that the workflow uses to run
    3.  A unique name to identify the settings used

Examples for each part would be:
    1. relaxation, static-energy, dynamics, ...
    2. vasp, abinit, qe, deepmd, ...
    3. jacks-test, matproj, quality00, ...

Together, an example workflow names would be:
    - `relaxation.vasp.jacks-test`
    - `static-energy.abinit.matproj`
    - `dynamics.qe.quality00`

When converting this to our workflow name in python, we need to replace
periods with 2 underscores each and convert our words to
[pascal case](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/camel-case-snake-case-pascal-case/).
For example, our workflow names become:
    - `Relaxation__Vasp__JacksTest`
    - `StaticEnergy__Abinit__Matproj`
    - `Dynamics__Qe__Quality00`

NOTE: Capitalization is very important here so make sure you double check
your workflow names.

Now let's test this out in python using a similar workflow name:
``` python
from simmate.workflow_engine import Workflow

class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings(Workflow):
    pass  # we will build the rest of workflow later

# These names can be long and unfriendly, so it can be nice to
# link them to a variable name for easier access.
my_workflow = Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings

# Now check that our naming convention works as expected
assert my_workflow.name_full == "example.pure-python.my-favorite-settings"
assert my_workflow.name_project == "example"
assert my_workflow.name_calculator == "python"
assert my_workflow.name_preset == "my-favorite-settings"
```

You now have a ready-to-use workflow name!


## Minimal example (Prefect vs. Simmate)

It's useful to know how Prefect workflows compare to Simmate workflows. For
simple cases where you have python code, you'd define a Prefect workflow
like so:

``` python
from prefect import flow

@flow
def my_favorite_workflow():
    print("This workflow doesn't do much")
    return 42

# and then run your workflow
state = my_favorite_workflow()
result = state.result()
```

To convert this to a Simmate workflow, we just need to change the format
a little. Instead of a `@flow` decorator, we use the `run_config` method
of a new subclass:

``` python
# NOTE: this example does not follow Simmate's naming convention, so
# some higher level features will be broken. We will fix in a later step.

from simmate.workflow_engine import Workflow

class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings(Workflow):

    @staticmethod
    def run_config():
        print("This workflow doesn't do much")
        return 42

# and then run your workflow
state = MyFavoriteWorkflow.run()
result = state.result()
```

Behind the scenes, the `run` method is converting our `run_config` to a
Prefect workflow for us.


### Full example

Now let's look at a realistic example where we build a Workflow that has
input parameters and accesses class attributes/methods:

``` python

class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings(Workflow):

    example_constant = 12

    @staticmethod
    def squared(x):
        return x ** 2

    @classmethod
    def run_config(cls, name, say_hello=True, **kwargs):

        if say_hello:
            print(f"Hello and welcome, {name}!")

        # grab class values and methods
        x = cls.example_constant
        example_calc = cls.squared(x)
        print(f"Our calculation gave a result of {example_calc}")

        # grab extra arguments if you need them
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            print(
                f"An extra parameter for {key} was given "
                "with a value of {value}"
            )

        return "Success!"
```

## Single S3Task + DatabaseTable

In many cases, you may have a workflow that runs a single calculation
and then writes the results to a specific database table. An example of
this would be an energy calculation using VASP. For common tasks
like this, the Workflow class is pre-configured to take an `S3Task`
and `DatabaseTable` -- including a default `run_config` method for you.
You can build your workflow like so:
    
``` python
from simmate.workflow_engine import Workflow

from my_app.tasks import ExampleS3Task
from my_app.models import ExampleTable

class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings(Workflow):
    s3task = ExampleS3Task
    database_table = ExampleTable

# try your workflow!
state = Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings.run()
result = state.result()
```

To learn more about making the S3Task and DatabaseTable, make sure you
have gone through all the Simmate 
[tutorials](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/tree/main/tutorials), 
including the advanced "Creating custom workflows" tutorial.

        There is a default run method implemented that is for S3Tasks.

        Builds a workflow from a S3Task and it's corresponding database table.

        Very often with Simmate's S3Tasks, the workflow for a single S3Task is
        the same. The workflow is typically made of three tasks:

        1. loading the input parameters and registering the calculation
        2. running the calculation (what this S3Task does on its own)
        3. saving the calculation results

        Task 1 and 3 always use the same functions, where we just need to tell
        it which database table we are registering/saving to.

        Because of this common recipe for workflows, we use this method to make
        the workflow for us.

        - `wait_for_run`:
            whether to wait for the workflow to finish. If False, the workflow
