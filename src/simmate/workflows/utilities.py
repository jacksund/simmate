    This is a utility for that grabs a workflow from the simmate workflows.

    This is typically used when we need to dynamically import a workflow, such
    as when calling a workflow through the command-line. We recommend avoiding
    this function when possible, and instead directly import your workflow.

    For example...
    ``` python
    from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow

    matproj_workflow = get_workflow("static-energy.vasp.matproj")
    ```

    ...does the same exact thing as...
    ``` python
    from simmate.workflows.static_energy import StaticEnergy__Vasp__Matproj
    ```

    Note the naming of workflows therefore follows the format:
    ``` python

    # an example import of some workflow
    from simmate.workflows.example_module import example_workflow_class

    ```

    #### Parameters

    - `workflow_name`:
        Name of the workflow to load. Examples include "relaxation.vasp.matproj",
        "static-energy.vasp.quality01", and "diffusion.vasp.all-paths"

    - `precheck_flow_exists`:
        Whether to check if the workflow actually exists before attempting the
        import. Note, this requires loading all other workflows in order to make
        this check, so it slows down the function substansially. Defaults to false.

    - `print_equivalent_import`:
        Whether to print a message indicating the equivalent import for this
        workflow. Typically this is only useful for beginners using the CLI.
        Defaults to false.
