"""

IMPORTANT!!!

We can't use the biblao server for our wyckoff data.

This is because a number of spacegroups are written based off of the wrong lattice.

For example, spacegroup 166 is written with the hexagonal lattice vectors, which
makes the smallest multiplicity 3 among all wy_sites. This in turn makes it so 
there is no possible wyckoff group combination that gives 2:1 stoich -- this is
misleading because we know that Ca2N has the spacegroup 166
