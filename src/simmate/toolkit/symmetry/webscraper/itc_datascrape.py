"""

Currently I grab the first table for each spacegroup, but in many cases there 
are more options. For example, spacegroup 10 has "Unique Axis b" and "Unique 
Axis c" tables to choose from -- by default I grab the first. The same goes for
spacegroups like 166 where there is a "Hexagonal" and "Rhombohedral" option. 
If instead I wanted to specify which to choose, I would look instead the headers
on each page. The headers should line up with the tables. For example in
spacegroup 166, I can see:
    if "HEXAGONAL AXES" in header.text
