"""
This module defines the Composition class.

It is a very basic extension PyMatGen's core Composition class, as it only adds
a few extra methods and does not change any other usage. Note that this class
is currently NOT used by Simmate's Structure class. For Simmate, 
Structure.composition will still return a pymatgen composition object.

        Gives the estimated element-element distances using the reported radii

        For example, Mg-O-F would give a symmetric matrix like...

            random structure creation, we make the default 0.5.
