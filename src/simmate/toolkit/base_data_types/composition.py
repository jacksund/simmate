This module defines the Composition class.

It is a very basic extension PyMatGen's core Composition class, as it only adds
a few extra methods and does not change any other usage. Note that this class
is currently NOT used by Simmate's Structure class. For Simmate, 
Structure.composition will still return a pymatgen composition object.

# BUG-FIX: Pymatgen has "special formulas" to control printing chemically
# reasonable formulas for compositions. For example, Hydrogen gas would show as
# H2 even if Composition("H1") was provided. This makes sense when PRINTING
# the formula; however, pymatgen uses this when returning the reduced formula.
# This causes issues in different places. For example, the assumption that
# composition.num_atoms >= composition_reduced.num_atoms fails to hold true.
# One place this showed up was the RandomSymStructure, which is unable to
# create structures with the "H1" or any other composition in the special
# formulas. I therefore disable special formulas. I would open a PR for
# pymatgen and limit the special formula use to the __str__ method, but I
# doubt it would be accepted... So I just patch it here.
