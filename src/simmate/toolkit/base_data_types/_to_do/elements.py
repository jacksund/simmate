class Element(Enum):
    """
    The Element class is really just a dictionary of fixed data, but we perform some
    extra python "tricks" to help with performance and usage.

    WARNING: This class implements some advanced python topics, and you don't need
    to understand them to use this class as a beginner. Check out element_data.py
    (and the csv file) to see which data is available. Also look at this link for a
    quick tutorial:
        << TODO: INSERT LINK >>

    The main performance boost comes from making this a subclass of Enum, which
    means there are fixed number of options to choose from. Further, once one is
    chosen, it never changes. This means we really only need one object instance
    for each element -- and any time we call Element("Al"), it will share that instance
    and data. This is effectively a "singleton" and helps us save on memory and
    object initialization in a big way.

    The second thing we do is "lazy-loading" of an Element's attributes. This helps
    with how fast we can create Element objects. In 99% of cases, we really don't need
    all of the data for an element -- just the symbol. Therefore, data isn't loaded
    and attached to Element objects until they need to be. Once you call that attribute,
    we then link it to the object and it's there for good. This helps with performance
    too because once an attribute is accessed, it will likely be accessed again.
