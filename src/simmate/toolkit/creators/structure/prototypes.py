class FromAflowPrototypes:
    """
    Generates structures of a target composition by using AFLOW prototypes as
    templates.

    # EXACT MODE
    Given a compositon, this class can be used to create structures from
    the **exactly-matching** prototypes in the AFLOW library. This means we
    are only using prototypes that have the same anonymous formula. For example,
    if you request structures for Ca2N to be made, only prototypes that have
    the AB2 anonymoous formula will be used (such as the MoS2 prototype).

    # ORDERED MODE
    Allow prototypes such as PbClF to be used on compositions like Ca2N
    (i.e. 3 wyckoff sites available and 3 sites to to create). Prototypes are
    selected based on wyckoff site multiplicity.

    # DISORDERED MODE
    (Not implemented yet)
    At the moment, this does NOT allow for disordered versions of prototypes.
    This would be like using a supercell of a 1-site prototype for a 2-site target
    composition. A concrete example of this is using the NaCl rocksalt prototype
    for a NaClBr or NaKClBr compositions -- each of these compositions would
    require a supercell of the NaCl prototype structure becuase they need more
    than 2 sites.

        #### Parameters

        - `composition`:
            The desired composition to create structures for

        - `allow_multiples`:
            Whether to allow structures where the reduced compositions are the
            same, but the actual number of sites differs. For example, Ca6N3
            would be allowed to return structures that give Ca2N, Ca8N4, and
            so forth.

        - `max_sites`:
            Maximum sites allowed in the created structures. This defaults to
            115 because this would include all prototypes in the aflow database
            (currently, the largest is prototype is 105 sites)

        - `mode`:
            The method to use for selecting prototypes. Options are "exact" and
            "ordered" (see class docstring above for what each does). Default
            is "exact"
