class XtaloptStructure(StructureCreator):
    """
    Uses randSpg (from the XtalOpt team) to create structures.

    see source: https://github.com/xtalopt/randSpg
    see tutorials: https://github.com/zbwang/randSpg/


    ## DEV NOTES
    We actually just want the submodule that creates structures for XtalOpt --
    this is RandSpg
    To install - https://github.com/xtalopt/randSpg
    I make this on Ubuntu using their directions (plus a little extra setup).

    First we need cmake installed. I had this already, but if it isn't there
    for you already use this command:
    ```
    sudo snap install cmake --classic;
    ```

    Download the randSpg files from github and extract them to your desktop

    Now we can run their compiling commands (starting in the main randSpg directory):
    ```
    mkdir build;
    cd build;
    cmake ..;
    make -j3;
    ```

    Copy the build/randSpg file to a separate /bin folder

    Add the following to the bottom of ~/.bashrc
    ```
    export PATH=/home/jacksund/Documents/github/randSpg/bin/:$PATH
    ```

    -------------------
    BUG: This section for python bindings is broken. Try without python bindings
    Next we need to have a python environment with pybind11 installed (this
    is just for making the files, you can use a different env after):
    ```
    conda create -n randspg -c conda-forge python=3.7
    conda activate randspg
    conda install -n randspg -c conda-forge pybind11
    ```
    Edit the CMakeLists.txt file, where we want to turn BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS
    from OFF to ON. (note - do this via the command line with nano)
    (after compile)
    Inside of the build/python folder, there is a file with a really long name
    -- looks like pyrandspg.cython......so. This is the file we will import
    the python module from.
    Move that file to your 'GitHub' directory (or wherever you can import from).
    Move the build directory whereever you'd like to store the installation.
    I put it in my home folder and renamed it from build to randSpg
    We can delete the rest.
