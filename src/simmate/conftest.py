"""
This module is for Simmate's test suite. You'll only use this if you are
contributing to the source code and making new tests.

Nearly all of Simmate's tests stem from toolkit objects, so this file loads sample
objects using the `toolkit.base_data_types` module. These Structures and 
Compositions can be used in any test.

Read more on pytest fixtures [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html).
This file helps share fixtures accross files as described 
[here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixtures-across-multiple-files).

    This is a test utility that takes a given directory and copies it's content
    over to a temporary directory. You'll often use this when you want to modify
    files within the test directory (which is often the case with ErrorHandlers).

    If the test_folder given is a compressed file, the zip contents will be
    unpacked and copied to the temporary directory. This is typically done when
    test files are extremely large (e.g. VASP output files)

    Here is an example use-case:
    ``` python
    from somewhere import ExampleHandler
    from simmate.conftest import copy_test_files

    def test_example(tmp_path):
