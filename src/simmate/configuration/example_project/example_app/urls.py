Want to make a website interface for your app? Then you'll need to fill this file
out! If you ever venture to this level, we strongly recommend you go through the
django tutorials first: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/

COMING SOON: Simmate will automatically build out views for a workflow based
on what your database table looks like. Let us know if you are waiting on this
feature, so we can prioritize it!
