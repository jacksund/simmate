# This is an example of how to connect to a postgres database on DigitalOcean.
# Note that our keywords and overall structure map directly to how databases 
# are defined in Django -- where this is a yaml format instead of a python
# dictionary (or json). You can have more than one database if you wish, but
# you MUST have one that is named "default" for Django+Simmate to work properly.
