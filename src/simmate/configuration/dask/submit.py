):
    """
    Given a function and a list of inputs that should be iterated over, this
    submits all inputs to a Dask local cluster in batches.

    This function has very specific use-cases, such as when we are submitting
    >100,000 tasks and each task is unstable / writing to the database. Therefore,
    you should test out Dask normally before trying this utility. Always give
    preference to Dask's `client.map` method over this utility.

    #### Parameters

    - `function`:
        Function that each kwargs entry should be called with.
    - `args_list`:
        A list of parameters that will each be submitted to function via
        function(*args).
    - `batch_size`:
        The number of calls to submit at a time. No new jobs will be
        submitted until the entire preceeding batch completes.
    - `batch_timeout`:
        The timelimit to wait for any given batch before cancelling the remaining
        runs. No error will be raised when jobs are cancelled. The default is
        no timelimit.
