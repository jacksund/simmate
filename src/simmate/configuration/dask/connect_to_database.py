"""
To prevent database-connection leaks, we want to setup django upfront when
a worker is started -- rather than have each task connect separately.

You can use this script like so...

``` python 
    from dask.distributed import Client
    client = Client(preload="simmate.configuration.dask.connect_to_database")
```

Note, there is also a high-level utility for this, which can be easier to
remember:
    
``` python
from simmate.utilities import get_dask_client
client = get_dask_client()

# The order that we import these different modules is important to prevent
# circular imports errors, so we prevent isort from changing this file.
# isort: skip_file

import logging

# We need to disable logging
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.disabled = True

# First setup django settings for simmate
from simmate.database import connect

# The settings (including the database) are all set up now, but django doesn't
# actually connect to the database until a query is made. So here, we do a
# very simple query that should work for any django database. We don't actaully
# need the output. We just want make a call that establishes a connection.
# Let's just use the ContentType table because it's typically small.
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

# and make a quick query
ContentType.objects.count()

# BUG: do I want to make a connection first? It looks like if the connection
# closes at any point, then all following tasks will fail -- that is, once
# the connection closes, no following tasks reopen it. Maybe if I don't establish
# the connection upfront, I can just let every task make their own.
# The error I get is...
#   Unexpected error: InterfaceError('connection already closed') dask
# This has only happened when I submit >5,000 flow runs, so there may be too
# many connections opened at that point. I'm not sure if that's actually the
# case though.

# BUG: for scaling Dask to many workers, I initially ran into issues of "too many
# files open". This is addressed in Dask's FAQ:
#   https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/faq.html#too-many-open-file-descriptors
# To summarize the fix...
#   (1) check the current soft limit (soft = no sudo permissions) for  files
#       ulimit -Sn
#   (2) to increase the softlimit, edit the limits.conf file and add one line
#       sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf
#           # add this line below
#           * soft nofile 10240
#   (3) close and reopen the terminal
#   (4) confirm we changed the limit
#       ulimit -Sn
#
# This may also be a leak of sockets being left open by Dask:
#   (1) get the PID of the running process with
#       ps -aef | grep python
#   (2) look at the fd's (file opened) by the given process
#       cd /proc/<PID>/fd; ls -l
#   (3) count the number of files opened by the given process
#       ls /proc/<PID>/fd/ | wc -l
#   (4) view overall stats with
#       cat /proc/<PID>/net/sockstat
#   (5) another option to list open files is
#       lsof -p <PID> | wc -l
#
# Whenever I see a heartbeat fail, I also see a massive jump in the number of
# files opened by the process. I believe zombie prefect runs are creating
# a socket leak.
