    This starts up a Dask cluster and a Prefect Agent in order to run Simmate jobs.

    This convenience command is really only meant for basic purposes, as Dask
    and Prefect teams offer their own commands with much more control. For
    example, this command uses Prefect's LocalAgent, but there are other
    advanced types available such as DockerAgent which may be better for your
    use case.

    If you would like this cluster to run endlessly in the background, you can
    submit it with something like "nohup simmate workflow-engine run-cluster &".
    The "nohup" and "&" symbol together make it so this runs in the background AND
    it won't shutdown if you close your terminal (or ssh). To stop this from running,
    you'll now need to find the running process and kill it. Use something like
    "ps -aef | grep simmate" to find the running process and grab its ID. Then
    kill that process id with "kill 123" (if the id was 123).
