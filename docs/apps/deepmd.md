# DeePMD Application

!!! danger
    Be aware that this application is currently undergoing initial testing and is not advised for use outside of the Warren Lab.

## Overview

The Deep Potential for Molecular Dynamics (DeePMD) is a software package designed to build machine-learned interatomic potentials using energy and force-field data. When trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data, these machine-learned potentials demonstrate significant efficiency in performing molecular dynamics simulations.

This software is open-source and available for free.
