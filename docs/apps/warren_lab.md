# The Warren Lab Application

## About

The Warren Lab App is a product of Scott Warren's Materials Discovery Lab at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill). Our lab focuses on electrides, fluoride-ion batteries, and 2D materials. 

The `Warren Lab` application incorporates workflows for our lab's preferred DFT settings and common analyses. Registering this app will introduce numerous new workflow presets that build on several other apps (VASP, Bader, BadELF, etc.).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

1. Add `warren_lab` (and it's dependencies) to the list of installed Simmate apps with:
``` bash
simmate config add warren_lab
```

2. For Bader & BadELF workflows, make sure you have the Bader command (from the Henkleman group) installed using one of two options:
      - (*for beginners*) Install [Docker-Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Then run the following command:
          ``` bash
          simmate config update "bader.docker.enable=True"
          ```
      - (*for experts*) Install Bader using [offical guides](http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/) and make sure `bader` is in the path

3. For VASP workflows, make sure you have the `vasp_std` command installed using one of two options:
      - (*for beginners*) Install [Docker-Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Then run the following commands:
          ``` bash
          simmate config update "vasp.docker.enable=True"
          simmate config update "vasp.docker.image=example.com:vasp/latest"
          ```

        !!! danger
            VASP is a commercial software, so we cannot provide Docker images for it. This is why you must provide a private image via `image=example.com:vasp/latest`.

      - (*for experts*) Install VASP using [offical guides](https://www.vasp.at/) and make sure `vasp_std` is in the path

4. Update your database to include custom tables from the app:
``` shell
simmate database update
```

5. Ensure everything is configured correctly:
``` shell
simmate config test warren_lab
```
