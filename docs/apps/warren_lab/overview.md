# The Warren Lab App

The Warren Lab App is created and maintained by Scott Warren's Materials Discovery lab at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill). The lab specicializes in electrides, fluoride-ion batteries, and 2D materials, so this app contains custom workflows and utilities to help with relevant analyses.

This app is currently maintained by [Sam Weaver](https://github.com/SWeav02).
