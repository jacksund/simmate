# Toolkit Overview

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About

The `Simmate Toolkit` serves as an alternative to `RDkit`, `OpenEye-Toolkit`, and other Python packages for cheminformatics.

Our toolkit is the product of...

- [x] Incorporating features from other toolkits (e.g., wrapping an RDkit function)
- [x] Creating more Pythonic and user-friendly APIs
- [x] Adding optional integrations with databases and workflows 

Our toolkit is "batteries-included", meaning it includes many features typically used in large projects. As a result, it requires a larger installation (i.e., more dependencies). However, this also means that larger projects can benefit significantly from using our toolkit instead of building features from scratch with toolkits like RDkit.

To understand how the Simmate Toolkit simplifies tasks, consider this script. The script...

1.  Reads an SDF file containing multiple molecules
2.  Removes all molecules with more than 3 stereocenters, more than 30 heavy atoms, and containing sodium (`Na`)
3.  Generates a list of InChI keys from the final set

This script is less intuitive and less Pythonic for other toolkits, but it's straightforward and clean with Simmate:

=== "simmate-toolkit"
    ``` python
    from simmate.toolkit import Molecule

    # STEP 1
    molecules = Molecule.from_sdf_file("example.sdf")

    # STEP 2
    molecules_filtered = []
    for molecule in molecules:
        if molecule.num_stereocenters > 3:
            continue
        if molecule.num_atoms_heavy > 30:
            continue
        if "Na" in molecule.elements:
            continue
        molecules_filtered.append(molecule)

    # STEP 3
    inchi_keys = [m.to_inchi_key() for m in molecules_filtered]
    ```

=== "rdkit"
    ``` python
    from rdkit import Chem
    from rdkit.Chem import FindMolChiralCenters, Descriptors

    # STEP 1
    molecules = []
    with Chem.SDMolSupplier("example.sdf") as supplier:
    for molecule in supplier:
        if mol is None:
            continue
        molecules.append(molecule)

    # STEP 2
    molecules_filtered = []
    for molecule in molecules:

        chiral_centers = FindMolChiralCenters(
            molecule,
            force=True,
            includeUnassigned=True,
            useLegacyImplementation=False,
        )
        if len(chiral_centers) > 3:
            continue
        
        nheavy = Descriptors.HeavyAtomCount(molecule)
        if nheavy > 30:
            continue

        has_na = False  # false until proven otherwise
        for atom in molecule.GetAtoms():
            if atom.GetSymbol() == "Na":
                has_na = True
                break
        if has_na:
            continue

        molecules_filtered.append(molecule)

    # STEP 3
    inchi_keys = [Chem.MolToInchiKey(m) for m in molecules_filtered]
    ```

=== "oe-toolkit"
    ``` python
    from openeye import oechem
    from openeye import oeiupac

    # STEP 1
    molecules = []
    with oechem.oemolistream("example.sdf") as ifs:
        for mol in ifs.GetOEMols():
            if mol is None:
                continue
            molecules.append(mol)

    # STEP 2
    molecules_filtered = []
    for mol in molecules:

        stereo_count = sum(1 for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.IsChiral())
        if stereo_count > 3:
            continue

        heavy_atom_count = sum(1 for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() > 1)
        if heavy_atom_count > 30:
            continue

        has_na = any(atom.GetAtomicNum() == 11 for atom in mol.GetAtoms())
        if has_na:
            continue

        molecules_filtered.append(mol)

    # STEP 3
    inchi_keys = [oeiupac.OECreateInChIKey(m) for m in molecules_filtered]
    ```
