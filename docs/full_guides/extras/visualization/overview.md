Simmate Visualization
---------------------

This module aids in the creation of plots and 3D models for data and structure visualization. It functions as an extension of the `pymatgen.ext` module.

NOTE: Currently, this module solely generates 3D models for `Structure` objects utilizing [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). We are actively planning and developing additional features.

In the meantime, we recommend using either [VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/) or [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/) for crystal structure visualization while we enhance our tools.
