Simmate Visualization
---------------------

This module is specifically designed to create plots and 3D models for data and structure visualization. It functions as an extension of the `pymatgen.ext` module.

NOTE: Currently, this module solely produces 3D models for `Structure` objects utilizing [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). We are actively planning and developing additional features.

As we work on improving these tools, we recommend using either [VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/) or [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/) for crystal structure visualization.
