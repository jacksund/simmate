File Converters
---------------

This module offers functions for reading and writing a variety of file types. It's specifically designed to manage different crystal structure representations, such as POSCAR, CASTEP, and CIF file formats. As such, it includes functions for converting between these formats. Moreover, this module also includes functions for converting between different object types, specifically various Python classes.

NOTE: Currently, this module only includes converters for the `structure` type. The `molecule` and `voxeldata` types are still under development.
