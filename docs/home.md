## About

The Simulated Materials Ecosystem (Simmate) is a toolbox and framework for computational materials research. It lets you explore various crystal databases, predict new materials, and quickly calculate properties.


## Before exploring the docs

This website holds all of our guides and API documentation. Before getting started here, you may way to check out... 

- our Github at [jacksund/simmate](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate). This is where we host our source code, discuss topics as a team, and answer user questions.
- our main website at [simmate.org](https://simmate.org/). Keep in mind -- only a small portion of features can be seen by exploring the website because we have limited resources for our website interface. The majority of our functionality is only available through the command-line and python.

## Need help or have a suggestion?

Post your question or feedback [here in our discussion section](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/discussions/categories/q-a). 

Even if it's a question like "_How do I download all structures with x, y, and z properties?_", let us help out and point you in the right direction!
