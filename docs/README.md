# Documentation

This directory hosts the build script for Simmate's online API documentation. You can access the live docs [here](https://jacksund.github.io/simmate/home/). If you would like to host our documentation locally for offline access, then you can run the following commands:

``` bash
mkdocs build
```

You can then open up the generated files to view the offline documentation.
