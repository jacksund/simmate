## Understanding Core Dependencies

As a newcomer to our community, you might initially engage in minor tasks such as correcting typos or adding small utilities/functions. However, if you aim to contribute more substantially, we highly recommend getting acquainted with our core dependencies. These include...

- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/) for our database and website
- [Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/core/) for our workflows and scheduler
- [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/futures.html) for clusters and execution

While you don't need to become an expert in these packages, a basic understanding of their functionalities will be advantageous.
