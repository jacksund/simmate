# Contributing to Simmate

In this guide, you will learn how to contribute new features to Simmate's code.


## Learning about core dependencies

When you first join our community, you may only be comfortable fixing typos and adding small utilities/functions. But if you would like to make larger changes/contributions, we highly recommend learning about our core dependencies. This includes...

- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/) for our database and website
- [Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/core/) for our workflows and scheduler
- [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/futures.html) for clusters and execution

You don't need to be an expert -- just aware of these packages and their features.
