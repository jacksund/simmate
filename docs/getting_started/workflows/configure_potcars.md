# Setting Up Potentials (for VASP users)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is VASP?

VASP is a widely used software for executing DFT calculations. However, our team cannot install it for you due to its commercial licensing. You need to [acquire it directly from the VASP team](https://www.vasp.at/), with whom we have no affiliation. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setting Up VASP

Even though VASP can only be installed on Linux, we will guide you through the process of configuring VASP on your local computer, regardless of whether it's a Windows or Mac system. For this, you only need the Potentials that come with the VASP installation files. You can either:

1. Extract these from the VASP installation files located at `vasp/5.x.x/dist/Potentials`. Remember to unpack the `tar.gz` files.
2. Request a copy of these files from a team member or your IT department.

After obtaining the potentials, place them in a folder named `~/simmate/vasp/Potentials`. This is the same directory where your database is located (`~/simmate`). Here, you need to create a new folder named `vasp`. This folder should contain the potentials that came with VASP, maintaining their original folder and file names. Once you've completed these steps, your folder should look like this:

```
# Located at /home/my_username (~)
simmate/
├── my_env-database.sqlite3
└── vasp
    └── Potentials
        ├── LDA
        │   ├── potpaw_LDA
        │   ├── potpaw_LDA.52
        │   ├── potpaw_LDA.54
        │   └── potUSPP_LDA
        ├── PBE
        │   ├── potpaw_PBE
        │   ├── potpaw_PBE.52
        │   └── potpaw_PBE.54
        └── PW91
            ├── potpaw_GGA
            └── potUSPP_GGA
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Verifying Your Configuration

If the folder is not set up correctly, subsequent commands may fail, resulting in an error like this:

``` python
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/jacksund/simmate/vasp/Potentials/PBE/potpaw_PBE.54/Na/POTCAR'
```

If you encounter this error, revisit your folder setup.
