# Should I set up my own database?

A cloud database lets you save your results to a remote computer through an internet connection, and once a database is set up, you can add as many users and connections as you'd like. Therefore, if you are part of a team, you only need ONE person to setup and manage ONE cloud database. Anyone can collaborate if they have a username and password.

So we could (theoretically) have the entire scientific community working together and sharing their results. To this end, our Simmate team tries to get as many labs collaborating as possible. If you would like join this effort, simply send an email to simmate.team@gmail.com and ask. Once you're on our team, you won't have to setup or manage any cloud database.

> :bulb: Collaborating with our team is 100% free, and we hope to keep it that way. We take on the costs of the cloud database for now, but as our database and community grows, we may need help with funding. Until then, don't hesitate to ask for our status.

If you would instead like a private database for your team, designate one person to be the database manager. Only that person needs to complete the next section (on setting up your cloud database). All other members, wait until you get connection information and then jump to the final section (on connecting to your cloud database).

So to summarize, only create your own cloud database if both of these conditions are met:
1. you prefer a private database instead of Simmate's collaborative effort
2. you are the point-person for managing your team's private database
