## Extra resources

- [Codecademy's python lessons](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) (we HIGHLY recommend spending 2-3 days going through if you're new to python. Learning the fundamentals is very important to using Simmate effectively.)
- [Introduction to Spyder](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/videos/first-steps-with-spyder.html) (The 3 videos are under 4 minutes each, so worth a quick watch)
