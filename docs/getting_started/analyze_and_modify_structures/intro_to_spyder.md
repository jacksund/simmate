# An Introduction to Spyder

Prebuilt workflows are beneficial for materials research, but they have their limitations. When you need to create new crystal structures, modify existing ones, or conduct unique analyses, Python becomes an essential tool. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Python Introductory Lessons

If you're new to coding and Python, we'll introduce the basic Python skills needed to use Simmate's toolkit in this tutorial. However, we strongly recommend dedicating 2-3 days to learn Python fundamentals. [Codecademy's Python lessons](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) are an excellent resource for beginners.

!!! tip
    Investing a full day or more in these tutorials will save you time and frustration in the long run. We strongly encourage you to take the time to complete them.

## Choosing our IDE

Whether you're ready or not, it's time to learn how to use Simmate's Python code. 

Remember from the Installation tutorial: Anaconda provided several programs on their home screen, including Orange3, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and others. These programs allow you to write your own Python code. Just as there are various platforms for writing papers, like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and LibreOffice, these programs offer different ways to write Python. 

Our team prefers Spyder, and we highly recommend it to our users.

## Launching Spyder

If you followed the installation tutorial correctly, Spyder should be installed and ready to use. To launch it, search for Spyder in your computer's apps (use the search bar at the bottom-left of your screen on Windows 10) and select `Spyder (my_env)`. 

Spyder will be empty when you first launch it. Here's a glimpse of what Spyder looks like when it's in use:

For this tutorial, we'll only be using the Python console (located at the bottom-right of the screen).

!!! tip 
    If you're already comfortable with Python or have completed the Codecademy intro course, you can quickly familiarize yourself with Spyder by watching their intro videos. [There are 3 videos, each under 4 minutes long](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/videos/first-steps-with-spyder.html).
