# The quick tutorial

> :warning: Simmate still uses [pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org/) under the hood, so this tutorial is really one for using pymatgen. [Their guides](https://pymatgen.org/usage.html) also are useful, but they are written for those already familiar with python.

1. In Spyder's python console, run `import simmate` to make sure everything is set up.
2. Make sure you still have our `POSCAR` file of NaCl from the last tutorial. 
3. Now let's explore the toolkit and a few of its features!

Load the structure into python and then write it to another file format:
```python
from simmate.toolkit import Structure
structure = Structure.from_file("POSCAR")
structure.to("cif", "NaCl.cif")
```

The `Structure` class (aka a `ToolkitStructure`) provides many extra properties and methods, so nearly all functions in Simmate use it as an input. This includes running workflows like we did in the previous tutorial. All available workflows can be loaded from the `simmate.workflows` module:
```python
from simmate.workflows.relaxation import mit_workflow
result = mit_workflow.run(structure=structure)
```

Grab varius properties of the structure, lattice, and composition:
```python
# explore structure-based properties
structure.density
structure.distance_matrix
structure.cart_coords
structure.num_sites

# grab the structure's composition and access it's properties
composition = structure.composition
composition.reduced_formula
composition.elements

# grab the structure's lattice and access it's properties
lattice = structure.lattice
lattice.volume
lattice.matrix
lattice.beta
```

Make new structures using some tranformation or analysis:
```python
structure.add_oxidation_state_by_guess()
structure.make_supercell([2,2,2])
new_structure = structure.get_primitive_structure()
```

What about advanced features? Simmate is slowly adding these to our toolkit module, but many more are available through [PyMatGen](https://pymatgen.org/) and [MatMiner](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/) (which are preinstalled for you).
```python
# Simmate is in the process of adding new features. One example
# creating a random structure from a spacegroup and composition

from simmate.toolkit import Composition
from simmate.toolkit.creators import RandomSymStructure

composition = Composition("Ca2N")
creator = RandomSymStructure(composition)

structure1 = creator.create_structure(spacegroup=166)
structure2 = creator.create_structure(spacegroup=225)

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Matminer is handy for analyzing structures and making
# machine-learning inputs. One common analysis is the generating
# a RDF fingerprint to help analyze bonding and compare structures

from matminer.featurizers.structure.rdf import RadialDistributionFunction

rdf_analyzer = RadialDistributionFunction(bin_size=0.1)

rdf1 = rdf_analyzer.featurize(structure1)
rdf2 = rdf_analyzer.featurize(structure2)

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pymatgen currently has the most functionality. One common
# function is checking if two structures are symmetrically
# equivalent (under some tolerance).

from pymatgen.analysis.structure_matcher import StructureMatcher

matcher = StructureMatcher()

# Now compare our two random structures!
# This should give False. Check in your Spyder variable explorer.
is_matching = matcher.fit(structure1, structure2)
```

There are many more features available! If you can't find what you're looking for, be sure to ask for help before trying to code something on your own. Chances are that the feature exists somewhere -- and if we don't have it, we'll direct you to a package that does.

## An introduction to Spyder

Prebuilt workflows can only take you so far when carrying out materials research. At some point, you'll want to make new crystal structures, modify them in some way, and perform a novel analysis. To do all of this, we turn away from the command-line and now start using python. If you are a brand new to coding and python, we will introduce the bare-minimum of python needed to start using simmate's toolkit in this tutorial, but we highly recommend spending 2-3 days on learning all the python fundamentals. [Codecademy's python lessons](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) are a great way to learn without installing anything extra.

Ready or not, let's learn how to use Simmate's python code. Recall from tutorial 1: Anaconda gave us a bunch of programs on their home screen, such as Orange3, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and others. These programs are for you to write your own python code. Just like how there is Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and LibreOffice for writing papers, all of these programs are different ways to write Python. Our team uses Spyder, so we highly recommend users pick Spyder too.

If you followed tutorial 1 exactly, you should have Spyder installed and ready to go. To open it, search for Spyder in your computer's apps (use the searchbar on the bottom-left of your screen on windows 10) and select `Spyder (my_env)`. Your Spyder will be empty when you first open it up, but here's a showcase of Spyder in full swing:

<!-- This is an image of the Spyder IDE -->

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spyder-ide/spyder/5.x/img_src/screenshot.png"  height=440 style="max-height: 440px;">
</p>

If you are comfortable with python or took the Codecademy intro course, you can get up to speed with Spyder with their intro videos. [There are 3 videos, and each is under 4 minutes](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/videos/first-steps-with-spyder.html).

For this tutorial, we will only be using the Python console (bottom-right of the screen).

## The `Structure` class

In real life, we might say that McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's are examples of restauraunts.  In python, we could say that `mcdonalds`, `burgerking`, and `wendys` are **objects** of the **class** `Restaurants`.  By organizing **objects** into **class**es, python simplifies the way we program. For example, we could design the `Restaurants` class to have a property called `menu`.  Then, we could view the menu simply by typing `wendys.menu` because `wendys` belongs to the **class** `Restaraunts` and all `Restaraunts` have a `menu`.

In materials science, the class we use most is crystal structure. In Simmate, we call this class `Structure`. A crystal structure is _**always**_ made up of a lattice and a list of atomic sites. Fortunately, this is exactly what we have in our `POSCAR` file from tutorial 2, so let's use Simmate to create an instance of the `Structure` class using our POSCAR file.

Start by entering this line into the python console and hit enter:

```python
from simmate.toolkit import Structure
```

This line says we want to use the `Structure` class from Simmate's code. The `Structure` class is now loaded into memory and is waiting for you to do something with it.

Next, make sure you have the correct working directory (just like we did with the command-line). Spyder lists this in the top right -- and you can hit the folder icon to change it. We want to be in the same folder as our POSCAR file.

Next, run this line in your python terminal:

```python
nacl_structure = Structure.from_file("POSCAR")
```

Here, we told python that we have a `Structure` and the information for it is located in the `POSCAR` file. This could be in many other formats, such as a CIF file. But we now have a `Structure` object and it is named `nacl_structure`. To make sure it loaded correctly, run this line:

```python
nacl_structure
```

It should print out...

```
Structure Summary
Lattice
    abc : 4.02463542 4.02463542 4.02463542
 angles : 59.99999999999999 59.99999999999999 59.99999999999999
 volume : 46.09614820053437
      A : 3.4854365146906536 0.0 2.0123177100000005
      B : 1.1618121715635514 3.2861010599106226 2.0123177100000005
      C : 0.0 0.0 4.02463542
PeriodicSite: Na (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000) [0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000]
PeriodicSite: Cl (2.3236, 1.6431, 4.0246) [0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000]
```

This is the same information from our POSCAR! Alternatively, we could have created this structure manually:

```python
# note we can name the object whatever we want. We use 's' here.
s = Structure(
    lattice=[
        [3.48543651, 0.0, 2.01231771],
        [1.16181217, 3.28610106, 2.01231771],
        [0.0, 0.0, 4.02463542],
    ],
    species=["Na", "Cl"],
    coords=[
        [0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],
        [0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000],
    ],
)
```

Whatever your method for creating a structure, we now have our `Structure` object and we can use its properties (and methods) to simplify our calculations.

For example, we can use it to run a workflow. We did this with the command-line in the last tutorial but can accomplish the same thing with python:

``` shell
# Using the command-line (from our previous tutorial)
simmate workflows run static-energy/mit --structure POSCAR
```

```python
# Using Python (in Spyder)

# This code does the exact same thing as the command above

from simmate.toolkit import Structure
from simmate.workflows.relaxation import mit_workflow

nacl_structure = Structure.from_file("POSCAR")
result = mit_workflow.run(structure=nacl_structure)
```

<br/> <!-- add empty line -->

## Properties of a `Structure` object

We make classes because they allow us to automate common calculations. For example, all structures have a `density`, which is easily calculated once you know the lattice and atomic sites. You can access this and other properties through our structure object. Try typing `nacl_structure.density` in the python terminal and hit enter. It should tell you the density!

Now what about other properties for the lattice, like volume, angles, and vectors? For the sake of organization, the `Structure` class has an associated class called `Lattice`, and within the `lattice` object we find properties like `volume`. Try out these in your python terminal (only run one line at a time):

```python
nacl_structure.lattice.volume
nacl_structure.lattice.matrix
nacl_structure.lattice.beta
```

Your outputs will be...

```
# EXPECTED OUTPUTS

46.09614820053437

array([[3.48543651, 0.        , 2.01231771],
       [1.16181217, 3.28610106, 2.01231771],
       [0.        , 0.        , 4.02463542]])

59.99999999999999
```

If you don't like to type long lines, there is a shortcut.  We save the `Lattice` object (here, we call it as `nacl_lat`, but you can pick a different name) to a new variable name and then call its properties:

```python
nacl_lat = nacl_structure.lattice
nacl_lat.volume
nacl_lat.matrix
nacl_lat.beta
```

Note, outputs will be the same as above.

We can apply the same idea to other `Structure` sub-classes, such as `Composition`. This allows us to see properties related to composition:
```
nacl_compo = nacl_structure.composition
nacl_compo.reduced_formula
nacl_compo.elements
```

This will give outputs of...

```
# EXPECTED OUTPUTS

Comp: Na1 Cl1

'NaCl'

[Element Na, Element Cl]  # <-- these are Element objects!
```

As you create new python objects and name them different things, you'll need help keep track of them. Fortunately, Spyder's variable explorer (a tab in top right window) let's us track them! Try double-clicking some of your variables and explore what Spyder can do:

</p>

## Methods of a `Structure` object

In addition to `properties`, an object can also have `methods`. Typically, a method will perform a calculation; it may also save the results of that calculation. For example, you might want to convert a conventional unit cell into a primitive unit cell.  You can do this with `nacl_structure.get_primitive_structure()`. Try this in your python console:

```python
nacl_structure.get_primitive_structure()
```

You'll see it prints out a new structure. We had the primitive structure already, so it should be identical to our output from before. For this method, we save it as a new `Structure` object by assigning it to the name `nacl_prim`:

```python
nacl_prim = nacl_structure.get_primitive_structure()
nacl_prim.density
```

Note that all methods end with parentheses `()`. This allows us to alter the method. For example, get_primitive_structure() makes use of symmetry in its calculation, so if we do:

```python
nacl_structure.get_primitive_structure(tolerance=0.1)
```

the calculation will allow atoms that are nearly in their 'symmetrically correct' positions (within 0.1 Å) to be identiified as symmetrical. Note, we didn't have to set a tolerance before because there are default values being used. Some methods don't have defaults. For example, the `make_supercell` method require you to specify a supercell size. 

There are many other methods available for structures too:

```python
nacl_structure.add_oxidation_state_by_guess()
nacl_structure.make_supercell([2,2,2])
```

To get a quick look at **all** of the properties and methods available, type `nacl_structure` into the terminal but don't hit enter yet. Then add a period so you have `nacl_structure.`, and finally, hit tab. You should see a list pop up with everything available. Select lattice, then do this tab trick again! The list should look similar to this (this image isn't for a structure object though):

</p>

This can be done with any class or any object. There are many different classes in Simmate, but you'll interact with `Structure` the most. To fully understand all of the options for these classes, you'll need to explore the code's documentation, which we will cover in the next tutorial (4).

## Advanced classes

To give you a sneak-peak of some advanced classes and functionality, we outline some examples in this section. Note that Simmate is still early in development, so there are many more features available through [PyMatGen](https://pymatgen.org/) and [MatMiner](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/) packages, which were installed alongside Simmate.

Simmate's toolkit is (at the moment) most useful for structure creation. This includes creating structures from random symmetry, prototype structures, and more.
We only need to give these "creator" classes a composition object:

```python
from simmate.toolkit import Composition
from simmate.toolkit.creators import RandomSymStructure

composition = Composition("Ca2N")
creator = RandomSymStructure(composition)

structure1 = creator.create_structure(spacegroup=166)
structure2 = creator.create_structure(spacegroup=225)
```

Matminer is particularly useful for analyzing "features" of a structure and making machine-learning inputs. One common analysis gives the "fingerprint" of the structure, which helps characterize bonding in the crystal. The most basic fingerprint is the radial distribution function (rdf) -- it shows the distance of all atoms from one another. We take any structure object and can feed it to a matminer `Featurizer` object:

```python
from matminer.featurizers.structure.rdf import RadialDistributionFunction

rdf_analyzer = RadialDistributionFunction(bin_size=0.1)

rdf1 = rdf_analyzer.featurize(structure1)
rdf2 = rdf_analyzer.featurize(structure2)
```

We can plot an RDF using python too. Matminer doesn't have a convenient way to plot this for us yet (with Simmate there would be a `show_plot()` method), so we can use this opportunity to learn how to plot things ourselves:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# The x-axis goes from 0.1 to 20 in steps 0.1 (in Angstroms).
# Matminer doesn't give us a list of these values but
# we can make it using this line.
rdf_x = [n/10 + 0.1 for n in range(0, 200)]

# Make a simple line plot with lists of (x,y) values
plt.plot(rdf_x, rdf1)

# Show the plot without any fancy formatting or labels.
plt.show()
```

Pymatgen is currently the largest package and has the most toolkit-like features. As an example, it's common to compare two structures and see if are symmetrically equivalent (within a given tolerance). You give it two structures and it will return True or False on whether they are matching:

```python
from pymatgen.analysis.structure_matcher import StructureMatcher

matcher = StructureMatcher()

# Now compare our two random structures!
# This should give False. Check in your Spyder variable explorer.
is_matching = matcher.fit(structure1, structure2)  
```

If you're trying to follow a paper and analyze a structure, odds are that someone made a class/function for that analysis! Be sure to search around the documentation for it (next tutorial teaches you how to do this) or just [post a question](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/discussions/categories/q-a) and we'll point you in the right direction.

Take some time to master Python and Spyder with the resources below, and when you're ready, advance to [the next tutorial](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/blob/main/tutorials/04_Explore_the_code.md).
