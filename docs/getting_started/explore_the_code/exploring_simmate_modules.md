# Navigating Simmate's Modules

Understanding that Simmate is essentially a collection of classes organized into directories, let's delve deeper.

We'll begin with the `toolkit` module. You can find it [here](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/tree/main/src/simmate/toolkit), but try to locate it independently without using the link. Upon opening it, you'll find a guide or overview. You can also access this module by using `from simmate import toolkit` and seeking help directly in Spyder.

```
from simmate import toolkit

toolkit  # press ctrl+I before pressing enter
```

A worthwhile directory to explore is the `simmate.toolkit.creators` module. It offers numerous methods to create lattices, sites, and structures (for example, randomly, random symmetry, etc.) and also integrates third-party codes.

Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the features and functions. Don't hesitate to inquire if a feature exists, and feel free to suggest new ones. Post your questions on our [discussions page](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/discussions/categories/q-a).

!!! warning
     Please note that Simmate is still in its early development stages, so some directories may be more comprehensive than others. Keep this in mind as you navigate. If you don't see a guide or documentation, it's likely that we haven't completed that module yet.
