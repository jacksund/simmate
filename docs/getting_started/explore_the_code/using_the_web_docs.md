## Using the web docs

Now that we understand how code is organized, we can explore online documntation more easily. The overall organization of our code (and how to use it) is known as our API (the application programming interface). You will find the same exact documentation above - but on a nicely formatted website. 

You can find our API documentation [here](https://jacksund.github.io/simmate/simmate.html).

When you're ready, you can advance to [the next tutorial](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/blob/main/tutorials/05_Search_the_database.md), which can be completed on your local computer.
