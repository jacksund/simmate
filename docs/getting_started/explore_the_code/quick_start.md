# Explore the code

!!! tip 
    If you are familiar with how to explore python documentation, you can skip this tutorial.

!!! tip 
    This entire tutorial should be run on your local computer because we will be using Spyder.

Even though you can run workflows without understanding what happens behind the scenes, you should avoid using Simmate like a [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box). In this tutorial, you will learn how to explore Simmate's code and features, rather than just copying/pasting code from other tutorials.

# The quick tutorial

1. Our API documentation is located [here](https://jacksund.github.io/simmate/simmate.html).
2. You can explore our source code on github in the same way as the online API docs. For example, note that the [scr/simmate folder](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/tree/main/src/simmate) has the same README as [our API documentation](https://jacksund.github.io/simmate/simmate.html).
3. We do this because we are a high-level code and want to avoid researchers using it as a [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box). We accomplish this by using [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/) for our documentation, rather than [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/examples.html).
