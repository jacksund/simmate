Even though you can run workflows without understanding what happens behind the scenes, you should avoid using Simmate like a [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box). In this tutorial, you will learn how to explore Simmate's code and features, rather than just copying/pasting code from other tutorials.
