# Explore the code

!!! note 
    If you are familiar with how to explore python code and documentation, you can skip this tutorial.

Even though you can run workflows without understanding what happens behind the scenes, you should avoid using Simmate like a [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box). In this tutorial, you will learn how to explore Simmate's code and features, rather than just copying/pasting code from other tutorials.
