# The `Structure` Class

!!! note
    This is the longest section of all our getting-started guides -- but take your time here and don't skip anything. Understanding the toolkit `Structure` class is essential when using Simmate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intro to Python Classes 

In Python, a class is like a blueprint that defines how something should be created. 

Let's say you want to describe a car. The class would define what a car is â€“ what attributes it has (like color, model, and speed) and what it can do (like drive or honk). Once you have this blueprint, you can create specific cars (objects) based on it. Each car you create is a unique instance of the class with its own characteristics. So, a class is like a template that helps you organize and create objects in your code.

This becomes incredibly powerful when we start building out functionality and analyses.

!!! example
    Consider these analogies: 
    
    - lions, tigers, and bears are examples of animals. In Python, we could say that `lion`, `tiger`, and `bear` are objects of the class `Animal`.
    - McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's are examples of restaurants. In Python, we could say that `mcdonalds`, `burgerking`, and `wendys` are objects of the class `Restaurant`.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## The `Structure` class

In materials science, the most commonly used class is for crystal structures. In Simmate, this class is called `Structure`. 

A crystal structure always consists of a lattice and a list of atomic sites. This is exactly what we have in our `POSCAR` file from tutorial 2. 

Let's use Simmate to create an object of the `Structure`. Enter this line into the Python console:

```python
from simmate.toolkit import Structure
```

This line loads the `Structure` class from Simmate's code it now ready to be used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary of Steps

Once we have our `Structure` class loaded & ready to help, analyzing a structure usually involves the following steps:

1. Loading a structure into Python
2. Cleaning up & modifying the structure as needed
3. Analyzing the structure's properties and features
4. Exporting the structure in a different format

While only the first step is mandatory, the rest are optional and can be customized according to your needs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Basic Example

Here's a script that covers each of the steps mentioned above:

``` python
from simmate.toolkit import Structure

# 1: Import
structure = Structure.from_file("POSCAR")

# 2: Clean / Modify
structure = structure.get_primitive_structure()

# 3: Analyze 
print(f"Density: {structure.density}")

# 4: Export
structure.to(filename="output.cif", fmt="cif")
```

In the steps below, we will walk through how to build your own script.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Load

Now, we will tell Python that we have a `Structure` and its information is located in the `POSCAR` file:

```python
nacl_structure = Structure.from_file("POSCAR")
```

!!! warning
    Before loading a structure, ensure you have the correct working directory (as we did with the command-line). Spyder displays this in the top right, and you can change it by clicking the folder icon. We want to be in the same folder as our `POSCAR` file.

To view the structure you just loaded:

```python
print(nacl_structure)
```

!!! tip
    There are MANY other ways to load structures, such as from different file formats or even python directly. To explore the different loading options, refer to our full guides.

    For example, you can create a structure directly in python:
    ``` python
    from simmate.toolkit import Structure

    structure = Structure(
        lattice=[
            [3.48543651, 0.0, 2.01231771],
            [1.16181217, 3.28610106, 2.01231771],
            [0.0, 0.0, 4.02463542],
        ],
        species=["Na", "Cl"],
        coords=[
            [0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],
            [0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000],
        ],
    )
    ```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Clean & Modify

With our structure loaded, we can now learn the importance of the `Structure` class. A `Structure` object will have `properties` and `methods` available to help us perform common tasks and calculations. A `property` is a characteristic of an object (such as density or volume), where a method performs a specific task using optional parameters (such as symmetry analysis).

Let's first learn about methods by cleaning our structure. We will converting it to the primitive unitcell and then create a 2x2x2 supercell.

**i: Symmetry reduction**

The `get_primitive_structure()` method can convert a conventional unit cell into a primitive unit cell:

```python
nacl_structure.get_primitive_structure()
```

This command will display a new structure, which should match the primitive structure we already have. You can also store the result in a new Structure object. For example:

```python
nacl_prim = nacl_structure.get_primitive_structure()
```

All methods end with parentheses `()`, which allow you to modify the method using optional input parameters. For example, the `get_primitive_structure()` method uses symmetry in its calculations, and you can adjust the tolerance for symmetry with:

```python
nacl_structure.get_primitive_structure(tolerance=0.1)
```

This command will identify atoms as symmetrically identical if they are nearly in their 'symmetrically correct' positions (within 0.1 Angstrom). If you don't specify a tolerance, the method will use a default value. 

**ii: Creating Supercells**

Some methods, require an input parameters. This includes the `make_supercell` method wich *must* be given the supercell size that you want it to make:

```python
nacl_structure.make_supercell([2,2,2])
```

    See our `Tips & Tricks` section below for viewing all available `Structure` methods

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Analyze

In step 2, we mentioned "properties" but did not show examples. We will use properties (and a few more methods) to analyze our structure.

**Basic properties:**

Properties are essentially fixed formulas that we can follow. For instance, all structures possess a `density` property, which can be computed once the lattice and atomic sites are known. The formula for this calculation remains constant, allowing for automation. 

Unlike methods, however, there are no optional parameters for properties. Therefore, we do not need `()` at the end of them. Try accessing some:
``` python
nacl_structure.density
nacl_structure.num_sites
nacl_structure.frac_coords
nacl_structure.cart_coords
```

**Advanced properties:**
Now, what if we want a bunch of properties relating to lattice such as volume, angles, and vectors? 

For better organization, the `Structure` class includes an associated class called `Lattice`. Within the `lattice` object, properties like `volume`, `angles`, `vectors` can be found. In other words, our `Structure` class is made up of smaller class objects like `Lattice`, `PeriodicSite`, and `Composition` that help us further organize properties and methods.

Try accessing the lattice and composition properties (run one line at a time):
``` python
# Lattice properties
nacl_structure.lattice.volume
nacl_structure.lattice.matrix
nacl_structure.lattice.beta

# Compostion properties
nacl_structure.composition.reduced_formula
nacl_structure.composition.elements
```

!!! tip
    See our `Tips & Tricks` section below for viewing all available `Structure` properties

!!! tip

    For convenience, you can use a shortcut. Save the `Lattice` object to a new variable name (here, it's `l`, but you can choose a different name) and then call its properties:

    ```python
    l = nacl_structure.lattice
    l.volume
    l.matrix
    l.beta
    ```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Export

Moving your structure from Python and back into a file will be our easiest step. There are a variety of formats available (`CIF`, `POSCAR`, `QE`, ...) which listed out in the full guides:

```python
structure.to(filename="output.cif", fmt="cif")
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Extra Tips & Tricks

### Viewing python variables

As you create new python objects and assign them different names, you'll need a way to keep track of them. Spyder's variable explorer (located in the top right window tab) can help with this. Try double-clicking on some of your variables to explore what Spyder can do:

<!-- This is an image of the Spyder IDE variable explorer -->
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px;">
<img src="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/_images/variable-explorer-execution.gif"  height=440 style="max-height: 440px;">
</p>

### Finding methods & properties

To see all the available properties and methods, type `nacl_structure` (or whatever your variable name is) into the terminal, add a dot (`.`), and then press `tab`. A list of options will appear. 

You can also explore the properties and methods of other classes, such as `lattice`, using the same method. The list should look something like this (note, this image uses numpy as an example):

### Running Python Structures in Workflows

`Structure` objects can be used to run a workflow. We did this with the command-line in the last tutorial but can accomplish the same thing with Python:

=== "python"
    ```python
    from simmate.toolkit import Structure
    from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow
    
    workflow = get_workflow("static-energy.quantum-espresso.quality00")
    nacl = Structure.from_file("POSCAR")
    result = workflow.run(structure=nacl)
    ```

!!! note
    As you get more confortable with Python, you'll learn that almost everything is a class or object. In fact,
    the workflow we just ran uses a `Workflow` class!

!!! tip
    As a shortcut, we could have just given the filename to our workflow:

    === "python"
        ```python
        from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow
        
        workflow = get_workflow("static-energy.quantum-espresso.quality00")
        result = workflow.run(structure="POSCAR")
        ```

    === "yaml"
        ``` yaml
        workflow_name: static-energy.quantum-espresso.quality00
        structure: POSCAR
        ```
