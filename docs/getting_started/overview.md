# Getting Started Tutorials

Welcome! :partying_face: These tutorials should help you get familiar with Simmate -- whether you're new to coding or a python expert. 

If anything is unclear, don't hesitate to [post a question on our forum](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/discussions/categories/q-a).


## Expected duration

If you are comfortable with python and the command-line, tutorials 01-05 should take under **1 hour in total**. Tutorials 06-09 will take **2-3 hours in total** but are optional.

If you are new to coding, we recommend you complete **one tutorial per day (1-2 hrs)** to fully understand each. This includes exploring extra resources in each tutorial. Keep in mind that tutorials 06-09 are advanced topics but also completely optional.


!!! tip
    Before starting any tutorials, we recommend that you [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one already. An account is optional but will allow you to post questions on our forum and sign-in to our website. A github account can also be used for optional services like cloud database hosting (covered in a later tutorial).
