# Getting Started Tutorials

Welcome! :partying_face: These tutorials are designed to help you get acquainted with Simmate, whether you're new to coding or a python expert.

If anything is unclear, don't hesitate to [ask a question on our forum](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/discussions/categories/q-a).


## Expected duration

If you are comfortable with python and the command-line, tutorials 01-05 should take under **1 hour in total**. Tutorials 06-09 will take **2-3 hours in total** but are optional.

If you're new to coding, we suggest you dedicate **one day (1-2 hrs) per tutorial** to fully grasp each concept. This includes exploring additional resources provided in each tutorial. Please note that tutorials 06-09 cover advanced topics and are entirely optional.


!!! tip
    We recommend creating a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) before starting the tutorials, if you don't have one already. While not mandatory, having an account will enable you to ask questions on our forum and log in to our website. Additionally, a GitHub account can be used for optional services like cloud database hosting (discussed in a later tutorial).
