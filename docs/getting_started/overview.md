# Getting Started Tutorials

## Getting help

We recommend creating a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) before starting the tutorials if you don't have one already. While not mandatory, having an account will enable you to ask questions on our forum and log in to our website.


## Expected duration

*Python Experts:* Tutorials 1-4 will take under 1 hour total, while tutorials 5-8 (optional) will take 2-3 hours total

*Beginners:* If you're new to coding, we suggest you dedicate one day (1-2 hrs) per tutorial in order to fully grasp the concepts introduced in each. Please note that tutorials 5-8 cover advanced topics and are entirely optional.

## Other software used

Some tutorials will ask beginners to install extra programs to aid with specific tasks: 

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- [Docker-Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) *(optional)*
- [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) *(optional)*
