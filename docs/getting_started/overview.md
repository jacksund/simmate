# Getting Started Tutorials

## Getting help

We recommend creating a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) before starting the tutorials if you don't have one already. While not mandatory, having an account will enable you to ask questions on our forum.


## Expected duration

*Python Experts:* Tutorials 1-4 will take under 1 hour total, while tutorials 5-8 will take 2-3 hours total

*Beginners:* If you're new to coding, we suggest you dedicate 1-2 hrs per tutorial in order to fully grasp the concepts introduced in each. Please note that tutorials 5-8 cover advanced topics and are entirely optional.

## Other software used

Some tutorials will ask beginners to install extra programs to aid with specific tasks: 

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
- [Docker-Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) *(optional)*
- [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) *(optional)*
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) *(optional)*

While there are paid tiers for some of these, you will not need them. Stick with the free versions.
