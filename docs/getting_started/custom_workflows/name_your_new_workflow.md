# Naming workflows

!!! warning
    Naming is very import! If you skip this step, your workflows will fail and cause errors elsewhere.

Naming your new workflow is an important step in Simmate. Features (such as the website interface) require that workflow names follow a certain format because this let's us do things such as determine where we can find your new workflow in the website interface. We follow a set of rules to arrive at workflow names like `relaxation.vasp.mit`.

First, we need to update the workflow name to match Simmate's naming
conventions, which includes:

1.  The type of analysis the workflow is doing
2.  The "calculator" (or program) that the workflow uses to run
3.  A unique name to identify the settings used

Examples for each part would be:

1. relaxation, static-energy, dynamics, ...
2. vasp, abinit, qe, deepmd, ...
3. jacks-test, matproj, quality00, ...

Together, an example workflow names would be:
- `relaxation.vasp.jacks-test`
- `static-energy.abinit.matproj`
- `dynamics.qe.quality00`

When converting this to our workflow name in python, we need to replace
periods with 2 underscores each and convert our words to
[pascal case](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/camel-case-snake-case-pascal-case/).
For example, our workflow names become:
- `Relaxation__Vasp__JacksTest`
- `StaticEnergy__Abinit__Matproj`
- `Dynamics__Qe__Quality00`

!!! warning
    Capitalization is very important here so make sure you double check your workflow names.

Now let's test this out in python using a similar workflow name:
``` python
from simmate.workflow_engine import Workflow

class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings(Workflow):
    pass  # we will build the rest of workflow later

# These names can be long and unfriendly, so it can be nice to
# link them to a variable name for easier access.
my_workflow = Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings

# Now check that our naming convention works as expected
assert my_workflow.name_full == "example.python.my-favorite-settings"
assert my_workflow.name_type == "example"
assert my_workflow.name_calculator == "python"
assert my_workflow.name_preset == "my-favorite-settings"
```

You now have a ready-to-use workflow name!
