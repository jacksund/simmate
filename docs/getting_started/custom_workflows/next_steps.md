# Taking things to next level 

There are still a lot of things we would want to do with our new workflow. For example, what if we want to...

- modify a complex workflow (such as `diffusion.vasp.neb-all-paths-mit`)
- create a custom workflow using a new program like USPEX or ABINIT
- use a custom database table to save our workflow results
- access the workflow in the website interface
- access our workflow from other scripts (and the `get_workflow` function)

For creating complex workflows and databases, you'll need to read through our API documentation, where we cover advanced cases. Also, don't be hesitate to [post a question on our forum](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/discussions/categories/q-a). We can also tell you the best place to start.

Accessing our workflow on the website or in scripts is much easier, and we will cover it in the next tutorial -- while we tackle custom database tables as the same time. Continue to [the next tutorial](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/blob/main/tutorials/07_Build_custom_datatables_and_apps.md) when you're ready.
