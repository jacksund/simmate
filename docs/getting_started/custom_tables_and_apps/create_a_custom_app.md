# Creating a new project

1. Let's create a project named `my_new_project`. To do this, navigate to a folder where you'd like to store your code and run...
``` bash
simmate start-project my_new_project
```

2. You will see a new folder named "my_new_project" which you can switch into.
``` bash
cd my_new_project
```

3. Open up the `README.md` file in this folder and read through our directions. If you want a web-form of this guide, use [this link](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/tree/main/src/simmate/configuration/example_project)

4. After completing the steps in that readme, you've now registered your workflow and database tables to simmate!
