## min_supercell_vector_lengths

When generating a supercell, this is the minimum length for each lattice vector of the generated cell (in Angstroms). For workflows such as NEB, larger is better but more computationally expensive.

=== "yaml"
    ``` yaml
    min_supercell_vector_lengths: 7.5
    ```
=== "toml"
    ``` toml
    min_supercell_vector_lengths = 7.5
    ```
=== "python"
    ``` python
    min_supercell_vector_lengths = 7.5
    ```
