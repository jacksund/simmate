This is the atomic species/element that will be moving in the analysis (typically NEB or MD diffusion calculations). Note, oxidation states (e.g. "Ca2+") can be used, but this requires your input structure to be oxidation-state decorated as well.

=== "yaml"
    ``` yaml
    migrating_specie: Li
    ```
=== "toml"
    ``` toml
    migrating_specie = "Li"
    ```
=== "python"
    ``` python
    migrating_specie = "Li"
    ```
