For workflows that involve generating a supercell or random structure, this will be the maximum number of sites to allow in the generated structure(s). For example, an evolutionary search may set this to 10 atoms to limit the compositions & stoichiometries that are explored.

=== "yaml"
    ``` yaml
    max_atoms: 10
    ```
=== "toml"
    ``` toml
    max_atoms = 10
    ```
=== "python"
    ``` python
    max_atoms = 10
    ```
