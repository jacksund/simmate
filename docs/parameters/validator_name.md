(experimental feature; advanced users only)
This parameter is the base validator class that should be used. The class will be initialized using `MyValidator(**validator_kwargs)`. The input should be given as a string.

!!! warning
    Currently, we only support `CrystallNNFingerprint` validation, so this should be left at its default value.
