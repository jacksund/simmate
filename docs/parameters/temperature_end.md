For molecular dynamics simulations, this is the temperature to end the simulation at (in Kelvin). This temperature will be reached through a linear transition from the `temperature_start` parameter.

=== "yaml"
    ``` yaml
    temperature_end: 1000
    ```
=== "python"
    ``` python
    temperature_end = 1000
    ```
