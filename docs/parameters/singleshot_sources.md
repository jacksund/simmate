## singleshot_sources
(experimental feature; advanced users only)
This parameter is a list of structure sources that run once and never again. This includes generating input structures from known structures (from third-party databases), prototypes, or substituting known structures.

In the current version of simmate, these features are not enabled and this input should be ignored.
