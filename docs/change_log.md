## Check your installed version

When importing simmate and establishing a connection to the database, a warning message will be displayed if your version is not the most recent one. You can also verify this via the command-line:

``` bash
simmate version
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Upgrading to the Latest Version

We strongly advise installing simmate in a fresh conda environment instead of updating it within your current environment:
``` shell
conda create -n my_env -c conda-forge python=3.11 simmate
```

Ensure that the expected version is installed:
``` bash
simmate version
```

Update your database to be compatible with the new installation:
``` bash
simmate database update
```

!!! warning
    The command `simmate database update` is only effective from `v0.15.0` onwards. Earlier versions of simmate necessitate a complete database reset when updating versions. So, if your original database version is `v0.14.0` or earlier, you must run `simmate database reset`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Understanding Version Numbers

Our releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This implies that versions (e.g., `v1.2.3`) correspond to `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Each version number increases following these changes:

  - `MAJOR` = incompatible API changes
  - `MINOR` = addition of new functionality (without API changes)
  - `PATCH` = bug fixes and documentation updates (without API changes)

There is one significant exception to the above rules -- `MAJOR=0` releases. Any `v0.x.y` release is considered developmental, where APIs are subject to change and are not deemed stable.

**Enhancements**

- add NEB base classes to inherit from for making new subflows
- improve formatting of logging and cli using `typer` and `rich`
- cli now supports auto-completion to help with long commands
- add `convergence_limit` parameter to evolutionary search that works alongside `limit_best_survival`. This will absorb minor changes in energy with equivalent structures from prolonging the search.
- add `ExtremeSymmetry` transformation to attempt symmetry reduction on disordered structure
- account for structures in `fixed-composition` having fewer nsites than input becuase of symmetry reduction during relaxation. Also, add `min_structures_exact` parameter to ensure we have at least N structures with the expected number of sites
- add experimental `variable-composition` (variable refers to nsites, not stoichiometry) and `binary-composition` evolutionary searches
- allow custom workflows to run from yaml
- update MatProj data to new api, and add severl new columns for data (e.g. mag + band gap)

**Refactors**

- isolate optional dependencies so that our install is smaller

- refactor & clean up transformation module for readability
- remove `SimmateFuture` class and merge functionality into `WorkItem`
- switch from pdoc to mkdocs for documentation and remove `get_doc_from_readme`. Code and doc organization are now decoupled.
- rename run commands based on user preference. the `run` is now `run-quick`. `run-yaml` is now `run`. `run-cloud` now assumes a yaml input.
- remove `tqdm` dependency in favor of `rich.progress`
- refactor transformations to static methods

**Fixes**

- fix `module not found` error by adding ASE to dependencies
- fix bug with postgres database trying to delete sqlite locally
- fix dask throwing errors with logging
- fix bug where `fixed-composition` searches fail to detect individuals that have been symmetrically reduced (and therefore have fewer nsites than expected)
- fix evolutionary search failures when writing output files while files are opened/locked
- fix NEB workflows failing due to Walltime handler
- fix NEB workflows hints for `workup` failure due to missing start/end image folders

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v0.9.0 (2022.08.17)

**Enhancements**

- improve the warning associated with workflow failure because of "command not found" issues
- workers now ignore and reset tasks that fail with "command not found". 2 workers failing with this error will result in the WorkItem being canceled

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v0.7.0 (2022.07.19)

**Enhancements**

- add guide for installing VASP v5 to Ubuntu v22.04 ([@scott-materials](https://github.com/scott-materials), [#183](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/183))
- add `simmate database load-remote-archives` command and `load_remote_archives` utility that populates all tables from `database.third_parties`
- add `load_default_sqlite3_build` utility that downloads a pre-built database with all third-party data present. This is an alternative to calling `load_all_remote_archives` if you are using sqlite3 and saves a significant amount of time for users.
- standardize workflow naming. Note this breaks from python naming conventions for classes ([#150](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/150))
- dynamically determine `register_kwargs` and rename property to `parameters_to_register`
- add full-run unittests that call workflows and vasp (without emulation)

- refactor `start-worker` command to use prefect instead of the experimental django executor
- remove experimental `workflow_engine.executor`
- move contents of `configuration.django.database` to `database.utilities`
- upgraded to Prefect v2 ("Orion"). This involved the refactoring the entire `workflow_engine` module, and therefore the entire workflow library. ([#185](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/pull/185)).


**0.7.1 (2022.07.19)**

- fix incorrect handling of prefect v2 futures by workflows

**0.7.2 (2022.08.03)**

- fix missing SVG files for web UI ([#196](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/pull/196)).

**0.7.3 (2022.08.04)**

- fix incorrect passing of `source` in NEB all-paths workflow causing it to fail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v0.6.0 (2022.06.25)

**Enhancements**

- add `AflowPrototypes` to the `database.third_parties` module (only includes data distributed through pymatgen)
- add new modules to `toolkit.structure_prediction` and `toolkit.creation`, including ones to provide `known`, `substitution`, and `prototype` based structures.
- add `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to all database tables
- check if there is a newer version of Simmate available and let the user know about the update
- add experimental `badelf` workflow for determining electride character
- add `electronic-structure` workflow which carries out both DOS and BS calculations
- add `database_obj` attribute to the `toolkit.Structure` base class that is dynamically set

- removed use of `-s`, `-c`, and `-d` shortcuts from the `workflows` commands
- refactor `relaxation/staged` workflow to run in single parent directory
- refactor evolutionary search algorithm (alpha feature)
- condense where parsing/deserialization of workflow parameters occurs to the refactored the `load_input_and_register` task. Originally, this would occur in multiple places (e.g. in the CLI module before submission, in the workflow run_cloud method, in the LoadInputAndRegister task, etc.) and involved boilerplate code. ([#173](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/pull/173))
- refactor experimental features `register_kwargs` and `customized` workflows
- refactor `LoadInputAndRegister` and `SaveOutputTask` to `load_input_and_register` and `save_result`

**Fixes**

- fix import for `visualization.structure.blender` module ([@bocklund](https://github.com/bocklund), [#180](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/180))
- fix bug where `command` or `directory` improperly passes `None` when they are not set in the `simmate workflows run` command
- fix bug where `update_all_stabilities` grabs incomplete calculations ([#177](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/pull/177))
- fix bug where SCF calculation is not completed before the non-SCF DOS or BS calculation and causes the workflows to fail ([#171](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/171))
- fix bug for Bader workflow by registering the prebader workflow ([#174](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/pull/174))
- fix bug where `source` is not determined with yaml-file submissions ([#172](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/172))

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v0.5.0 (2022.05.30)
- update CI to test all OSs and pin pytest<7.1 as temporary fix for [#162](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/162)
- fix spelling typos in `keyword_modifiers` ([@laurenmm](https://github.com/laurenmm), [#165](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/pull/165))
- users can now apply their own unique keyword modifiers to Incars -- such as how we allow "__per_atom" or "__smart_ismear" tags on Incar settings. This change involved refactoring how `keyword_modifiers` are implemented for the `vasp.inputs.Incar` class. Rather than static methods attached to the base class, modifiers are now dynamically applied using the `add_keyword_modifier` classmethod.
- large update of `calculators.vasp.tasks` module where many new presets are reimplemented from [`pymatgen.io.vasp.sets`](https://pymatgen.org/pymatgen.io.vasp.sets.html). This includes robust unit testing to confirm that generated inputs match between simmate and pymatgen (see [#157](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/157) for a list of presets)
- catch error with vasp freezing when `Brmix` handler switches to kerker mixing ([@becca9835](https://github.com/becca9835), [#159](https://github.com/jacksund/simmate/issues/159))
