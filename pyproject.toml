# This file establishes the info needed to install simmate via pip, how to
# upload it to PyPI, and how to run python packages like pytest and coverage.

# For more information on this file and how to make similar ones, see:
#    https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html
#    https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject

# For the details on conda-forge installation see:
#    https://github.com/conda-forge/simmate-feedstock

# Note, for utilities like pytest and coverage, we prefer to use this file
# over files like "pytest.ini" because pyproject.toml has more uses that
# we may need in the future (i.e. it can use other modules).
