# This workflow will check for Black formating, install Python dependencies using Anaconda, and then run tests with a single version of Python.
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions
# 
# We also use a third-party action for setting up our conda environment. See:
#   https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-miniconda
#
# OPTIMIZE: consider switching to mamba for faster CI installs:
