# This workflow will check for Black formating, install Python dependencies using Anaconda, and then run tests with a single version of Python.
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions
#
# We also use a third-party action(s) for setting up our conda environment. See:
